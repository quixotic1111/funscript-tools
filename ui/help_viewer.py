1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This tool converts a .funscript file (position vs time) into a set of
e-stim control signals for use with restim. One funscript in, multiple
output files out — each controlling a different dimension of sensation.

OUTPUT FILES:
  *.alpha / *.beta           Electrode X/Y position (where you feel it)
  *.e1 / *.e2 / *.e3 / *.e4 Motion axis electrode intensities (4P mode)
  *.frequency                Pulse rate envelope
  *.pulse_frequency          Action-speed-mapped pulse rate
  *.volume                   Amplitude envelope (how strong)
  *.pulse_width              Pulse duration (fullness vs sharpness)
  *.pulse_rise_time          Pulse attack (hard vs soft onset)
  *.speed / *.accel          Speed and acceleration signals

WORKFLOW:
  1. Load a .funscript file (drag-and-drop or Browse)
  2. Adjust settings across the tabs
  3. Click "Process All Files" or "Process Motion Files"
  4. Output files appear next to the input file

================================================================================
2. GENERAL TAB
================================================================================

Rest Level (0.0-1.0)
  Signal level when volume ramp or speed is zero. Higher = more baseline
  sensation during quiet moments. 0.4 is a good starting point.

Ramp Up Duration After Rest (0-10 sec)
  How long to fade from rest level back to full output after a pause.
  0 = instant snap back, 5 = gentle ramp. Prevents jarring transitions.

Speed Window (0.5-30 sec)
  Rolling window for speed calculation. This is the single most impactful
  setting for how responsive the output feels.
    Smaller (0.5-1):  Tracks fast strokes, noisier signal.
    Default (2):      Good balance.
    Larger (3-5):     Smooth, averaged, sluggish response.
  Also affects alpha/beta radius scaling (faster = bigger radius).

Accel Window (0.5-10 sec)
  Same concept applied to the speed signal to derive acceleration.
  Measures how fast the speed itself is changing.
    Smaller (1):    Catches sudden speed changes.
    Default (3):    Balanced.
    Larger (4-6):   Smoother acceleration curve.

Processing Options:
  Normalize Volume       Scale volume to use the full 0-1 range.
  Delete Intermediary    Remove temp files after processing.
  Overwrite Existing     Replace output files if they already exist.

================================================================================
3. SPEED TAB
================================================================================

Calculation Method
  Three algorithms for deriving speed from position data. Each uses the
  Speed Window and Accel Window from the General tab, but interprets them
  slightly differently.

  ROLLING AVERAGE (original, default)
    Backward-looking rectangular window. Averages the absolute velocity of
    every consecutive sample pair within the window. O(n^2).
    + Biggest dynamic range (fast sections pop, slow sections drop near zero)
    + Most familiar behavior
    - Sluggish on fast transients, box-car artifacts at window edges

  EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGE (EMA)
    Single-pass exponential decay. Recent samples weighted more, old ones
    fade smoothly. O(n) — much faster on long scripts.
    + Smoothest output, no box-car artifacts
    + Zero-lag at the trailing edge
    - Slower to respond to sudden changes (retains "memory")
    - Window parameter is half-life, not hard cutoff

  SAVITZKY-GOLAY DERIVATIVE
    Fits a local polynomial to the position data and takes its analytical
    derivative. Best at preserving the shape of individual stroke peaks.
    Falls back to EMA if scipy is not installed.
    + Best peak preservation — tracks stroke shape, not just average
    + Clean acceleration signal (polynomial 2nd derivative)
    - Requires scipy

  Savitzky-Golay Options (visible when Savitzky-Golay is selected):

    Polynomial Order (2-5, default 3)
      Degree of the polynomial fitted to each window of samples.
        2 (quadratic):  Very smooth, rounds off peaks. Good for noisy scripts.
        3 (cubic):      Standard — good balance of shape and smoothness.
        4-5:            Tracks sharper features but amplifies noise.

    Fit Window Factor (0.05-0.5, default 0.15)
      Fraction of Speed Window used for the polynomial fit.
        0.05:   Very short fit, tracks every wiggle.
        0.15:   Good balance.
        0.3-0.5: Broader fit, smooths over short strokes.

    Post-Smoothing (0.0-1.0, default 0.25)
      EMA smoothing applied on top of the savgol derivative.
        0.0:   Raw derivative, maximum detail, may be spiky.
        0.25:  Gentle smoothing (default).
        0.5-1.0: Heavy smoothing, approaches pure EMA behavior.

  PRACTICAL COMBOS:
    Clean, deliberate strokes:  Order 3, Fit 0.15, Smooth 0.25
    Fast/percussive:            Order 4, Fit 0.08, Smooth 0.15
    Noisy/jittery:              Order 2, Fit 0.3,  Smooth 0.4
    Raw analysis:               Order 3, Fit 0.1,  Smooth 0.0

Interpolation Interval (0.01-1.0 sec)
  Resampling density before speed/accel calculation.
    0.02 (default):  50 pts/sec, good balance.
    0.01:            100 pts/sec, captures faster transients, slower.
    0.05-0.1:        Faster processing, loses high-freq detail.
  Also sets the alpha/beta output grid density.

Normalization Method
  max:  Normalize so the fastest moment = 1.0.
  rms:  Normalize by RMS (root mean square) energy.

Speed / Acceleration Preview
  Click "Refresh Preview" to see how your settings transform the signal.
  Check "Compare all methods" to overlay all three methods (Rolling Average
  in blue, EMA in green, Savitzky-Golay in orange) on the same data.
  If a .funscript is loaded, the preview uses your actual file; otherwise
  it generates a synthetic fast/slow/fast test signal.

================================================================================
4. FREQUENCY / VOLUME / PULSE TABS
================================================================================

These tabs control how the remaining output dimensions are derived from
the speed and acceleration signals. Refer to the inline labels and
tooltips in each tab for parameter-specific guidance.

================================================================================
5. MOTION AXIS (3P) TAB
================================================================================

Controls alpha/beta generation (the 2D spatial position of the stimulus).
The algorithm setting is the most important choice here:

  Circular          Semicircular path (180 degrees). Smooth, natural.
  Top-Left-Right    Three-quarter circle sweep (270 degrees).
  Top-Right-Left    Quarter circle sweep (90 degrees).
  Restim Original   Full circle per segment, random direction changes.

Key parameters:
  Min Distance from Center   How close to center the pattern can collapse.
  Speed Threshold %          What speed percentile maps to full radius.
  Direction Change Prob      (Restim Original only) Chance of flipping direction.

Phase Shift creates delayed *-2.funscript variants for devices that play
two alternating scripts per axis for a richer stim feel.

================================================================================
6. UNDERSTANDING E1-E4 AXES — HOW ELECTRODES INTERPRET SIGNALS
================================================================================

The E1-E4 system is a four-electrode linear array. Unlike the alpha/beta
system (which positions a single stimulus in 2D space), the E1-E4 system
drives four independent electrodes arranged in a line. Each electrode
has its own intensity signal.

PHYSICAL LAYOUT:
  The electrodes are arranged in a straight line with equal spacing:

    E1 -------- E2 -------- E3 -------- E4
    |<- spacing ->|<- spacing ->|<- spacing ->|

  Typical spacing is 10-30 mm depending on your device. You enter
  your actual spacing in the Physical Model section.

WHAT EACH AXIS DOES:
  Each axis file (e1.funscript, e2.funscript, etc.) contains a value
  from 0 to 1 at each moment in time:

    0.0 = electrode is OFF (no stimulation)
    1.0 = electrode is at FULL intensity
    0.5 = electrode is at half intensity

  The restim software reads all four files simultaneously and drives
  each electrode independently. What you feel is the combined effect
  of all four electrodes firing at their respective intensities.

HOW A SINGLE SOURCE BECOMES FOUR DIFFERENT SIGNALS:
  Your source funscript is a single 1D signal — position over time.
  The E1-E4 system transforms this one signal into four by applying
  a different response curve to each axis:

    Source position (0-1) ---> [Response Curve E1] ---> E1 intensity
                          ---> [Response Curve E2] ---> E2 intensity
                          ---> [Response Curve E3] ---> E3 intensity
                          ---> [Response Curve E4] ---> E4 intensity

  Each response curve is a remapping function. For example:
    Linear:     input 0.5 -> output 0.5 (passthrough)
    Ease In:    input 0.5 -> output 0.2 (quiet at low positions, strong at high)
    Inverted:   input 0.5 -> output 0.5 (high input -> low output)
    Sharp Peak: input 0.5 -> output 1.0 (spikes in the middle)

  By giving each electrode a different curve, the same source motion
  creates a spatially varied sensation — different electrodes respond
  to different parts of the stroke.

EXAMPLE — HOW A STROKE PLAYS ACROSS FOUR ELECTRODES:
  Suppose the source goes from 0 (bottom) to 1 (top) over 1 second.
  With these curves:
    E1: Ease In      (quiet at bottom, strong at top)
    E2: Sharp Peak   (spikes in the middle)
    E3: Inverted     (strong at bottom, quiet at top)
    E4: Bell Curve   (strongest at mid-range, quiet at extremes)

  As the stroke rises from 0 to 1:
    t=0.0s (pos=0.0): E1=low  E2=low   E3=HIGH E4=low   <- E3 dominates
    t=0.3s (pos=0.3): E1=low  E2=med   E3=med  E4=HIGH  <- E4 peaks
    t=0.5s (pos=0.5): E1=med  E2=HIGH  E3=med  E4=HIGH  <- E2+E4 peak
    t=0.7s (pos=0.7): E1=med  E2=med   E3=low  E4=med   <- spreading out
    t=1.0s (pos=1.0): E1=HIGH E2=low   E3=low  E4=low   <- E1 dominates

  The sensation "travels" from E3 -> E4 -> E2 -> E1 as the stroke rises.
  On the way back down, the pattern reverses.

SIGNAL ROTATION (ANGLE MANIPULATION):
  Before the response curve is applied, the input signal can be rotated
  around its center (0.5) by an angle. This effectively compresses or
  inverts the input range that each axis sees:

    0 degrees:   Normal input (unchanged).
    90 degrees:  Signal compressed to a flat line at 0.5 (cos(90)=0).
    180 degrees: Signal inverted (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0).

  By giving each axis a different rotation angle, you can make them
  respond to different "views" of the same source signal — similar to
  how rotating a microphone changes what it picks up.

THE FULL PROCESSING CHAIN (in order):
  1. Source funscript (position 0-1 over time)
  2. Signal rotation (angle manipulation, if set)
  3. Response curve (remaps input to output)
  4. Modulation (sine LFO wobble, if enabled)
  5. Cascade delay (physical model time shift, if enabled)
  6. Phase shift (dual *-2 variant, if enabled)
  7. Save to *.e1.funscript, *.e2.funscript, etc.

  Steps 2-3 shape WHAT each electrode does.
  Step 4 adds TEXTURE (wobble/shimmer).
  Step 5 adds SPATIAL MOTION (traveling sweep).
  Step 6 creates dual-variant files for alternating playback.

COMPARISON: ALPHA/BETA (3P) VS E1-E4 (4P):

  ALPHA/BETA (3P):
    - Two signals: X and Y position.
    - Controls WHERE a single stimulus point moves in 2D space.
    - All the stimulation is at one point; the point moves.
    - Good for: circular/sweeping patterns, focused sensation.

  E1-E4 (4P):
    - Four signals: one intensity per electrode.
    - Controls HOW MUCH each electrode fires independently.
    - Multiple electrodes can fire simultaneously at different levels.
    - Good for: spatial texture, traveling waves, complex patterns.

  You can generate both simultaneously (enable both in the tabs) and
  let restim layer them together, or use one mode exclusively.

PRACTICAL GUIDE — CHOOSING RESPONSE CURVES:
  Start simple and add complexity:

  STEP 1 — All Linear:
    All four axes pass through the source unchanged. Every electrode
    does the same thing. Boring, but it confirms your setup works.

  STEP 2 — One curve different:
    Set E1 to Ease In, keep others Linear. Now E1 responds more to
    the top of each stroke. You'll feel spatial asymmetry.

  STEP 3 — Complementary pairs:
    E1 = Ease In (strong at top), E3 = Inverted (strong at bottom).
    Now up-strokes light up E1, down-strokes light up E3. The sensation
    has directionality.

  STEP 4 — Full differentiation:
    Give each axis a unique curve. Use the Waveform Preview to see how
    the four outputs look before processing. Add modulation for texture,
    cascade delay for spatial sweep.

================================================================================
7. MOTION AXIS (4P) TAB — E1-E4 GENERATION
================================================================================

Generates four electrode-intensity files (E1-E4) using configurable
response curves. Each axis has:

  Enabled checkbox      Turn the axis on/off.
  Edit Curve button     Open the curve editor to shape the response.
  Curve visualization   Shows the current response curve graphically.

The response curve maps input position (0-1) to output intensity (0-1).
A linear curve passes the signal through unchanged. Shaped curves
(ease-in, sharp-peak, inverted, etc.) give each electrode a different
character.

Angle Manipulation
  Rotates the input signal before applying the curve. Useful for giving
  each axis a different "view" of the same source signal. Enter degrees
  for each axis and click Apply.

Config Presets
  Save, load, clone, rename, delete, export, and import complete axis
  configurations. Useful for A/B testing different curve setups.

Waveform Preview
  Shows the input signal and all four axis outputs stacked. Click
  "Refresh Preview" after changing settings. Zoom and scroll to inspect
  details.

================================================================================
8. CURVE EDITOR
================================================================================

Click "Edit Curve" on any E1-E4 axis to open the curve editor. The editor
has three resizable panels that you can drag to resize:

LEFT PANEL — Curve Presets + Library
  Built-in presets (Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Bell Curve, Inverted,
  S-Curve, Sharp Peak, Gentle Wave) are always available.

  Below the built-in presets, your saved curves appear with a star:
    Linear
    Ease In
    ...
    --- Saved Curves ---
    * My Custom Curve
    * Percussion Spike

  Buttons:
    Load               Apply the selected preset/curve to the editor.
    Save to Library    Save the current curve by name. Built-in names
                       are reserved — you'll be prompted with "My <name>"
                       if you try to use one.
    Delete from Lib    Remove a saved curve (built-in presets can't be deleted).
    Rename             Rename a saved curve.

  The curve library is stored in curve_library.json and persists across
  sessions and config resets. Any curve saved from any axis can be loaded
  onto any other axis.

CENTER PANEL — Interactive Canvas
  Click to add control points. Drag points to move them. Right-click to
  delete. The curve updates in real time as you edit.

  The title above the plot shows the curve name. If you modify a built-in
  preset's control points, the name automatically changes to
  "Custom (<original name>)" to prevent accidentally overwriting the
  built-in definition.

RIGHT PANEL — Control Points
  A table showing all X,Y coordinates. Click a row to select it and
  fill the X/Y entry fields below.

  Coordinate Entry:
    X: [___]  Y: [___]
    [Add Point]  [Update Point]  [Remove Point]
    [Bulk Entry...]

    Add Point      Adds a new point at the entered X,Y.
    Update Point   Overwrites the selected point's coordinates.
    Remove Point   Deletes the selected point.
    Enter key      Smart: updates the selected point if one is selected,
                   adds a new point if none is selected.

  Bulk Entry:
    Opens a text dialog where you can type or paste multiple X,Y pairs:
      0.000, 0.000
      0.250, 0.100
      0.500, 0.800
      1.000, 1.000

    Flexible formats: "0.5, 0.8" or "0.5 0.8" or "(0.5, 0.8)" all work.
    Lines starting with # are ignored. Choose "Replace all" to start fresh
    or "Append" to add to existing points. Duplicate X values merge
    automatically (last one wins).

BOTTOM BUTTONS:
  Restore Default   Reset to the code-defined factory default for this
                    axis (E1=Linear, E2=Ease In, E3=Ease Out, E4=Bell Curve).
  Reset             Revert to the curve as it was when the editor opened.
  Cancel            Close without saving.
  Save Curve        Save the current curve to the axis config.

BUILT-IN PRESET PROTECTION:
  If you load "Ease In", drag some points, and click Save — the curve is
  automatically renamed to "Custom (Ease In)". This prevents the built-in
  preset's name from being associated with wrong control points. The real
  Ease In is always available in the presets list.

  Protected names: Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Bell Curve, Inverted,
  S-Curve, Sharp Peak, Gentle Wave.

================================================================================
9. MODULATION (PER-AXIS LFO)
================================================================================

Each E1-E4 axis has a modulation row below the Enabled/Curve controls:

  [x] Modulation   Freq (Hz): [0.5]   Depth: [0.15]   [x] Phase [180] deg

WHAT IT DOES:
  Adds a gentle sine-wave wobble on top of whatever the axis is already
  doing. Think of it as texture or shimmer — the axis signal slowly
  oscillates around its base value.

HOW IT WORKS:
  The signal is shrunk from [0,1] into [depth, 1-depth] to make headroom,
  then a sine LFO is added. This ensures the wobble has full amplitude
  everywhere (even at the center and extremes) without clamping.

  When modulation is enabled, the axis is automatically resampled to
  60 Hz so the wobble has enough sample density to exist, even on
  sparse source scripts.

PARAMETERS:
  Frequency (Hz)    How fast the wobble cycles. 0.5 Hz = one wobble every
                    2 seconds. Typical slow-texture range is 0.1-3 Hz,
                    but higher values are allowed (e.g., 8 Hz on E2 and
                    16 Hz on E4 to layer per-electrode fast LFOs). At
                    high frequencies, the funscript timestamp resolution
                    (resampled to 60 Hz internally) caps the effective
                    fidelity — treat ~20-25 Hz as a practical ceiling.

  Depth (0-0.5)     How big the wobble is. 0.15 = the value swings +/-15%
                    of full range. Higher = more intense wobble.

  Phase checkbox    Toggles whether the phase offset is applied.
                    When off, phase is treated as 0 degrees.

  Phase (degrees)   Where in the wobble's cycle this axis starts.
                    Only matters when multiple axes modulate at the same
                    frequency — it determines their relationship:
                      0 vs 180 = counter-phased (one up, other down)
                      0 vs 90  = quadrature (circular feel)
                      0 vs 0   = in unison (no point)

  DEFAULT PHASE OFFSETS:
    E1 = 0 deg, E2 = 180 deg, E3 = 90 deg, E4 = 270 deg
    This gives you counter-phased pairs (E1/E2) and quadrature (E3/E4)
    automatically.

APPLIES TO:
  - Response-curve E1-E4 (Motion Axis 4P tab, section 7).
  - Traveling Wave E1-E4 (section 15). Each axis's modulation block is
    applied as a post-processing step on the wave's output envelope.
  - NOT Trochoid Spatial (the radial projection writes its own
    intensity directly without going through the per-axis modulation
    post-step).

================================================================================
10. PHYSICAL MODEL (CASCADE DELAY)
================================================================================

Located in the Motion Axis (4P) tab, below the phase-shift controls.
This creates apparent motion — the sensation of the stimulus physically
traveling across your electrode array.

HOW IT WORKS:
  For a linear e1-e2-e3-e4 electrode arrangement, each axis is delayed
  by a different amount so the stimulus sweeps across electrodes:

    E1: 0 ms delay (fires first)
    E2: 1 x step delay
    E3: 2 x step delay
    E4: 3 x step delay (fires last)

  Where step = (electrode spacing / propagation speed) x 1000 ms.

  This is NOT based on literal nerve conduction velocity (which would give
  sub-millisecond delays too small to matter). Instead it's based on
  cutaneous apparent motion — the psychophysical illusion where spatially
  separated stimulations fired in quick succession feel like continuous
  traveling motion. The optimal timing for this illusion is 20-200 ms,
  which is right where these delays land.

PARAMETERS:
  Enabled           Master toggle. Processing ignores this section when off.

  Spacing (mm)      Physical distance between adjacent electrodes.
                    Measure your device once and type it in. Default 20 mm.

  Speed (mm/s)      Apparent-motion propagation speed.
                      100 mm/s (Slow sweep):   Deliberate, stretched-out.
                      300 mm/s (Natural touch): Perceptual sweet spot.
                      1000 mm/s (Fast sweep):   Quick but still perceptible.

  Preset dropdown   Quick-select for common speed values plus "Custom".

  Sweep direction   Three modes:
    e1 -> e4          Fixed: always sweeps toward E4.
    e4 -> e1          Fixed: always sweeps toward E1.
    follow signal     Flips direction based on the source signal:
                      Up-strokes sweep e1->e4, down-strokes sweep e4->e1.
                      Feels like the stim is tracking the motion.

  The "follow signal" mode detects strokes in the source and applies
  direction-matched cascade shifts per stroke. A minimum stroke duration
  filter (100 ms) prevents micro-wobbles from triggering rapid flip-flops.

  TRANSITION HANDLING (follow signal mode):
    At direction changes, some axes experience overlap (new stroke starts
    before old finishes) and others experience gaps (new stroke hasn't
    arrived yet). Resolution:
      Overlap: newer stroke wins (older tail truncated).
      Gap: axis holds its last value until the new stroke reaches it.
    These artifacts are small on deliberate strokes and invisible to
    the nervous system at typical timing values.

LIVE PREVIEW:
  The label next to the controls shows:
    step 66.7 ms   sweep 200.0 ms (follows signal)
  "step" is the delay per electrode hop. "sweep" is the total time from
  first electrode to last (step x 3).

================================================================================
11. ANIMATION VIEWER
================================================================================

Click the "Animation Viewer" button in the bottom bar to open a popup
window showing an animated visualization of your output.

The viewer has three panels, each independently togglable:

TRAJECTORY PANEL (top left)
  Shows the alpha/beta position as an animated dot tracing a path.
    Gray path:   Full trajectory (static, faint).
    Blue trail:  Last 40 points, showing recent direction.
    Red dot:     Current position.
    Dashed circle: Electrode boundary. Cross: center (rest).

  2D MODE (default):
    Flat XY view of the alpha/beta path.

  3D MODE (check "3D"):
    X = Alpha, Y = Beta, Z = Time. The trajectory becomes a color-coded
    ribbon (blue=early, red=late). Click and drag to rotate. Top-down
    recovers the 2D perspective; side view shows temporal structure.

BARS PANEL (top right)
  Four colored bars (E1-E4) showing each electrode's intensity at the
  current moment. Animates in sync with the trajectory dot.
  E1 = blue, E2 = orange, E3 = green, E4 = red.

DIMMER STRIP / WATERFALL (bottom, full width)
  Shows E1-E4 intensity over the full timeline. E1 is at the top.

  HEATMAP MODE (default):
    Four horizontal rows. Color = intensity using the inferno colormap:
    black = off, dark red = dim, orange = medium, yellow/white = full.
    A white vertical playhead sweeps across during playback.

  WATERFALL MODE (check "Waterfall"):
    2D ridge plot — each electrode gets its own horizontal band with a
    filled waveform showing intensity. Colored by electrode. Useful for
    seeing individual electrode waveform shapes and comparing them.

  FOLLOW MODE (enabled by default):
    The dimmer strip auto-scrolls to keep a window centered on the
    playhead during playback. Adjust the "Window" size (in seconds)
    to control how much context is visible. Set to 5s for detail,
    20s for overview. The waveform scrolls past like an oscilloscope.

    When Follow is off, use the manual Zoom and scroll controls.

PANEL TOGGLES:
  The "Show" panel in the controls row lets you turn each panel on/off
  AND switch between processing modes for the displayed data:
    [x] Trajectory   [x] Bars   [x] Dimmer   |   [x] 3D   [x] Waterfall
                                              |   [x] Trochoid   [x] Snap-honest   [x] Spatial

  Render-only toggles (don't recompute data):
    Trajectory / Bars / Dimmer  Show or hide that panel.
    3D                          2D (default) or 3D trajectory view.
    Waterfall                   Heatmap (default) or stacked waterfall
                                for the dimmer.

  Data-changing toggles (re-prepare the trajectory and electrode signals):
    Trochoid       Apply trochoid quantization (snap input to N curve-
                   derived levels) before deriving alpha/beta and E1-E4.
                   Defaults to whatever the global config has when you
                   opened the viewer; can be flipped here for A/B
                   comparison without touching the Trochoid tab.
    Snap-honest    Only meaningful when Trochoid is on. Off (default) =
                   linear interpolation between funscript samples
                   (matches what the playback device actually does).
                   On = zero-order hold (bars/dimmer jump between snapped
                   levels so the quantization is visually obvious).
    Spatial        Use trochoid-spatial mapping for E1-E4 instead of the
                   per-axis response curves. Defaults to the global
                   trochoid_spatial.enabled config flag. When on, the
                   four electrodes are driven by the curve geometry
                   (see section 14).

  Disabling panels you don't need improves animation performance:
    All panels:      ~55-60 FPS
    Dimmer only:     ~100 FPS
    Trajectory only: ~80 FPS

  At least one panel must be enabled.

DIMMER ANTI-ALIASING:
  Long files combined with quantization can produce a "forest of vertical
  lines" in the dimmer because the heatmap downsamples a dense matrix
  into a smaller pixel grid. The dimmer now auto-pools the matrix
  columns down to ≤2400 (max-pool, so peaks survive). When this happens
  you'll see a console line like:
    [dimmer] downsampled 30000 -> 2308 cols (chunk=13) for display anti-aliasing
  This makes the rendering readable; the actual signal data on disk is
  unaffected.

NaN GUARD:
  Any non-finite values in the E1-E4 channels are replaced with 0.0
  before rendering (and the count is logged), so stray "magenta" pixels
  from the inferno colormap's bad-value rendering can't appear.

ZOOM (dimmer strip):
  Zoom: [400] %   up to 8000%
  At 100%: full timeline. At 8000%: sample-level detail.
  A scrollbar appears when zoomed in for manual panning.
  During playback with Follow on, the view auto-centers on the playhead.

PLAYBACK CONTROLS:
  Play / Pause       Start/stop animation. Loops at the end.
  Timeline scrubber  Drag to jump to any point.
  Time entry         Type a number (seconds) and press Enter to jump
                     directly to that time.
  Speed              Playback speed: 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x.

DATA SOURCE:
  If a .funscript is loaded, the viewer uses it with your current settings
  (algorithm, response curves, modulation, cascade, etc.).
  If no file is loaded, it generates a synthetic 10-second demo.
  Settings are read from the UI at the moment you open the viewer.

================================================================================
12. SIGNAL ANALYZER
================================================================================

Click the "Signal Analyzer" button in the bottom bar. It examines your
loaded funscript and recommends optimal settings based on signal
characteristics.

TROCHOID TOGGLE:
  At the top of the analyzer window, next to the source label, there's
  a checkbox: "Apply trochoid quantization to source". When on, the
  loaded funscript is quantized BEFORE metrics are computed — so the
  summary, classification, charts, and recommendations all reflect
  the quantized signal that the processor will actually produce.
  Defaults to whatever the global config has when the analyzer opens;
  toggling it re-runs the full analysis. The source label gains a
  "[trochoid: hypo, N=23]" suffix when the override is active.

WHAT IT MEASURES:

  Stroke Metrics:
    - Stroke count and strokes per minute (SPM)
    - Median stroke rate (Hz) and rate variability
    - Stroke amplitude distribution (mean, P25, P75)

  Temporal Metrics:
    - Total and active duration
    - Rest fraction (time where speed < 5% of max for > 2 seconds)
    - Rest period count and locations
    - Mean active segment length

  Speed Metrics:
    - Speed percentiles (P25, P50, P75, P95, max)

  Frequency Metrics:
    - Dominant frequency (FFT-based)
    - High-frequency energy ratio

  Position Metrics:
    - Position distribution histogram
    - Effective position range (P5 to P95)

CLASSIFICATION:
  Based on the metrics, the script is classified:
    Pace:        slow (<30 SPM), moderate (30-80), fast (80-150), very fast
    Variability: steady, moderate, highly variable
    Intensity:   subtle, moderate, intense
  Example: "FAST, MODERATE VARIABILITY — 120 SPM, moderate pacing..."

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  The analyzer produces 9-12 specific setting recommendations:

  Speed Method:
    High variability -> savgol (preserves peaks)
    Low variability  -> rolling_average (steady signal)
    Moderate         -> ema (smooth response)

  Speed Window:
    Approximately 2 stroke cycles at the median rate.
    Clamped to [1, 30] seconds and to 80% of mean active segment length.

  Accel Window:
    60% of the recommended speed window, clamped to [1, 10].

  Interpolation Interval:
    Fast signal (p95 speed > 3) -> 0.01 (dense sampling)
    Slow signal (p95 speed < 0.5) -> 0.05 (coarser OK)
    Moderate -> 0.02

  Savgol Options (when savgol is recommended):
    Polynomial order: 4 if high-frequency content, else 3.
    Fit window factor: scales inversely with variability.
    Post-smoothing: scales with variability.

  Rest Level:
    High rest (>30%) -> 0.3 (low for contrast)
    Low rest (<5%)   -> 0.5 (higher baseline)
    Moderate         -> 0.4

  Modulation:
    Frequency = sub-harmonic of stroke rate (rate x 0.3).
    Depth: small strokes -> 0.25, big strokes -> 0.08, moderate -> 0.15.

  Physical Model:
    Speed = 200 + 200 x stroke_rate_hz, clamped to [100, 1000].
    Direction: variable pacing -> "follow signal", steady -> fixed.

VISUALIZATIONS (4 charts):
  1. Position Distribution  — where the signal spends time
  2. Stroke Amplitude       — histogram of per-stroke amplitudes
  3. Instantaneous Speed    — speed over time, rest periods shaded
  4. Stroke Rate            — local SPM over time with average line

APPLYING RECOMMENDATIONS:
  The table shows: Setting | Current | Recommended | Reason
  Settings that differ from current are highlighted in red.

  Apply All:       Writes all recommendations to the config.
  Apply Selected:  Only applies rows you've selected in the table.
  Close:           Closes without applying.

  After applying, the table refreshes — matched settings are no longer red.

  IMPORTANT: Recommendations are a starting point, not final values.
  Always reprocess and test in restim after applying. Tune by feel.

================================================================================
13. CURVE QUANTIZATION (TROCHOID TAB)
================================================================================

Snap every position value in your input funscript to one of N discrete
levels derived from a parametric curve. Useful for creating rhythmic,
mechanical-feeling stim patterns where the position only ever lands on
specific "rungs", and for crafting unusual non-uniform stairstep responses
based on geometric curve math (hypotrochoid, rose, butterfly, etc.).

When enabled, quantization is the FIRST processing step — applied to the
main funscript before speed, alpha/beta, E1-E4, frequency, volume, and
pulse derivations. Every downstream output therefore inherits the snap.

WHERE IT FITS IN THE PIPELINE:

    Input .funscript
        |
        v
    [Curve Quantization]   <-- pre-pipeline, applied here
        |
        v
    Speed / Alpha / Beta / E1-E4 / Frequency / Volume / Pulse
        |
        v
    Output files

THE CONTROLS

  Enable curve quantization
    Master toggle. Off = pipeline runs unchanged.

  Curve family
    Picks which parametric curve generates the level set. Each family has
    its own parameter pane below the family selector. Switching family
    keeps the parameters you typed for the previous one (per-family Vars
    are persistent within a session and saved to config).

  Number of points (N)   2-256, default 23
    The curve is sampled at N evenly spaced theta values. Each sample
    becomes one quantization level. After projection some levels may
    coincide; the actual count is shown in the preview as
    "N unique" — e.g. "23 unique" or "21 unique" if there were duplicates.

  Projection             radius | y | x
    A 2D curve must reduce to 1D to give level values. The N curve points
    are projected to a single scalar:
      radius:  sqrt(x^2 + y^2)  — symmetric, always positive (default).
      y:       y-coordinate     — emphasizes vertical structure.
      x:       x-coordinate     — emphasizes horizontal structure.
    The N projected scalars are then normalized to [0, 1] and used as
    quantization levels. Different projections of the same curve produce
    very different level distributions.

  Deduplicate consecutive identical samples
    After snapping, neighboring samples often land on the same level.
    By default these are kept (faithful to the original time grid).
    Enable this option to drop redundant interior samples in each
    "plateau", keeping only the first and last sample of each value-run.
    Why keep both: playback devices linearly interpolate between
    consecutive funscript samples. Keeping the LAST sample of a plateau
    ensures the device holds the position until the next change instead
    of sloping across the plateau. The first/last pair acts as the
    bookends of the held value.
    Effect: typically cuts sample count by 50-80% with no audible change
    in playback. Useful for keeping device buffers responsive on long
    scripts.

THE CURVE FAMILIES

  hypo — Hypotrochoid (rolling inside)
    x(t) = (R - r) cos(t) + d cos(((R - r)/r) t)
    y(t) = (R - r) sin(t) - d sin(((R - r)/r) t)

    The hypotrochoid is the path traced by a pen attached to a small
    circle of radius r as it rolls without slipping INSIDE a larger
    fixed circle of radius R. The pen sits at distance d from the
    rolling circle's center.

    Params:
      R (outer radius, > 0)
        Sets the bounding container size. Larger R = wider overall
        pattern. The R/r ratio is what really shapes the curve:
          - Integer ratios produce closed curves (the pen returns to
            its start). Example: R=5, r=3 closes after 3 turns of the
            outer circle.
          - Irrational ratios trace forever without ever closing.
          - The number of distinct lobes/petals is approximately
            R / gcd(R, r) for integer ratios.

      r (rolling radius, > 0, ≠ R)
        Smaller r relative to R = more lobes/petals.
          - r ≈ R/3 to R/5: classic Spirograph-style multi-petal patterns.
          - r ≈ R/2: simple bipolar patterns.
          - r close to R: soft, almost-circular single-loop shapes.

      d (pen offset)
        Three distinct regimes:
          1. d = r:  TRUE HYPOCYCLOID — sharp pointed cusps where the
                     pen touches the outer circle (e.g. astroid for R=4,
                     r=1).
          2. d < r:  CURTATE TROCHOID — pen is inside the rolling
                     circle. Rounded loops, no cusps. The smaller d/r,
                     the more circular the result.
          3. d > r:  PROLATE TROCHOID — pen is outside the rolling
                     circle. Self-intersecting loops/knots.

    Classic Spirograph patterns. The N quantization points trace evenly
    around this curve, so the radius (sqrt(x^2+y^2)) projection gives
    levels clustered around the petal radii — strong "rest" levels with
    a few accent peaks.

    Try: R=5, r=3, d=2 (default — gentle rounded multi-loop)
         R=8, r=3, d=5 (pronounced loops, prolate regime)
         R=4, r=1, d=1 (4-cusped astroid — very angular levels)
         R=5, r=2, d=2 (5-pointed quasi-star)

  epi — Epitrochoid (rolling outside, "hypertrochoid")
    x(t) = (R + r) cos(t) - d cos(((R + r)/r) t)
    y(t) = (R + r) sin(t) - d sin(((R + r)/r) t)

    Same idea as hypo, but the rolling circle rolls around the OUTSIDE
    of the fixed circle. R, r, d have the same roles and the same three
    d-regimes (cusps / curtate / prolate) as hypo. Pattern lives outside
    the fixed circle — looks like daisy petals, gear-tooth shapes, or
    flowery rosettes.

    Try: R=5, r=3, d=2 (default — gentle rosette)
         R=4, r=1, d=2 (cardioid-like with one big lobe)
         R=3, r=1, d=1 (nephroid — 2 cusps)
         R=6, r=1, d=1.5 (6-petal flower)

  rose — Rose curve   r = a * cos(k * t)
    Params: a (amplitude), k (petal frequency).
    Petal count: k petals if k is odd, 2k petals if even.
    The level distribution clusters near 0 (when r ~ 0) and 1
    (at petal tips) — produces a "soft floor + accent peaks" feel.
    Try: a=1, k=5 (5 petals) or a=1, k=4 (8 petals).

  lissajous — Lissajous figure
    x(t) = A * sin(a*t + delta),   y(t) = B * sin(b*t)
    Params: A, B (amplitudes), a, b (frequencies), delta (phase rad).
    a:b ratio determines the figure's structure. delta rotates it.
    Try: A=B=1, a=3, b=2, delta=pi/2 (3:2 figure).
    Try: A=B=1, a=5, b=4, delta=0 (5:4 lattice).

  butterfly — Temple Fay's butterfly curve
    r(t) = e^cos(t) - 2*cos(4t) + sin(t/12)^5
    x(t) = scale * r * sin(t),  y(t) = scale * r * cos(t)
    Sampled over [0, 12*pi) — the full butterfly traces over six full
    rotations of t. Params: scale only.
    Highly non-uniform level distribution; perfect for organic "natural"
    feeling quantization with lots of values clustered near a "rest"
    radius and a few extreme reaches.

  superformula — Gielis superformula
    r(t) = ((|cos(m*t/4)/a|)^n2 + (|sin(m*t/4)/b|)^n3)^(-1/n1)
    Params: a, b, m (symmetry order), n1, n2, n3 (shape exponents).
    Extremely flexible — can produce circles, polygons, stars, blobs,
    flowers, pinched shapes, by varying the exponents.
    Try: a=b=1, m=6, n1=1, n2=7, n3=8 (default — soft hexagonal flower).
    Try: a=b=1, m=4, n1=12, n2=15, n3=15 (rounded square / supershape).

  custom — User-entered x(t) and y(t)
    Enter two expressions in numpy syntax. Available functions:
      sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 sinh cosh tanh
      exp log log2 log10 sqrt cbrt abs sign floor ceil round
      pow minimum maximum
    Available constants: pi, e, tau (= 2*pi).
    The variable t ranges over [0, 2*pi).
    Examples:
      x(t) = sin(3*t) + 0.5*sin(7*t)        y(t) = cos(2*t)
      x(t) = t * cos(t)                     y(t) = t * sin(t)        (spiral)
      x(t) = sin(t) * (1 + 0.3*cos(5*t))    y(t) = cos(t) * (1 + 0.3*cos(5*t))   (flower)

    SECURITY: expressions are evaluated in a sandboxed namespace with
    __builtins__ disabled. Imports, file I/O, and attribute access via
    dunder names ("__") are rejected. Safe for local use; do not paste
    untrusted expressions if you don't trust their author.

LIVE PREVIEW

  Three subplots in the Preview panel:

    Top-left:  The curve geometry in 2D, with the N sampled points
               highlighted as red dots.

    Top-right: A "rug plot" of the N normalized quantization levels
               between 0 and 1. Title shows how many unique levels
               survived projection (some may coincide).

    Bottom:    "Signal before/after" — a fragment (first 10 sec) of the
               loaded input funscript with the raw signal overlaid in
               grey and the quantized signal in black, with horizontal
               red lines marking the level grid.
               Title shows zoom %, render mode, and dedup status.

  Interactive controls for the bottom subplot:

    Signal Zoom   100-8000 %. Combobox with common values, or type your
                  own and press Enter. Scrollbar appears below the figure
                  when zoom > 100 %.

    Reset View    Zoom 100 % + scroll 0.

    Clear Playhead   Removes the green vertical playhead line.

    Show as: Interpolated / Step
      DEFAULT: Interpolated. Plots the snapped signal as a normal line
        with sample points marked as dots. THIS IS WHAT THE DEVICE
        ACTUALLY DOES — funscript playback linearly interpolates between
        consecutive samples, so the on-device behavior is sloped lines
        between successive snapped values, not square steps.
      Step: Plots the snapped signal as a step function (flat held value
        with vertical jumps). Useful for visualizing the snap edges,
        but NOT how the device will reproduce the signal.

    Mouse interactions (signal subplot only):
      Left-click           Set the playhead at that time. Label updates
                           with the raw and snapped values at that moment.
      Left-click + drag    Pan horizontally. Respects the current zoom.
      Scroll wheel         Zoom in/out, anchored on the cursor position.
      Right-click          Clear the playhead.

  All three subplots refresh live when you change family, N, projection,
  any family parameter, or the dedup toggle — and the change also
  propagates to the main 4P Waveform Preview so you can see the
  quantization affecting the E1-E4 outputs in real time.

ABOUT "DIGITAL-LOOKING" OUTPUT

  Quantization makes the position only land on N specific values, so
  consecutive samples that snap to the same value form flat plateaus.
  In the preview's Step mode this looks like a square wave. In reality
  the device interpolates between samples — so the actual playback will
  smoothly ramp from one snapped value to the next over the time gap
  between them, then hold flat across plateaus. The Interpolated render
  mode shows this truthful view.

  If consecutive samples snap to DIFFERENT levels (because they're far
  apart in input value), the device will linearly slide between them
  over the time delta between samples. If your input has dense samples
  (60+ Hz) and the snap changes every sample, those slides happen so
  fast they FEEL near-instantaneous — that's the closest you get to
  true digital character. Lower input density or stronger plateaus
  give a more "stairstep" feel.

  Tuning levers for the digital/analog spectrum:
    More N + low input density   = analog-like (small steps, close samples)
    Few N + high input density   = digital-like (big steps, fast slides)
    Dedup ON                     = honest plateau hold
    Step render mode             = false visual sharpness
    Interpolated render mode     = truthful

USAGE RECIPES

  Recipe 1 — "Mechanical 7-position lock"
    Family:        hypo (or any)
    Points:        7
    Projection:    radius
    Use case:      Force a stroke into 7 discrete positions. Strokes will
                   feel ratcheted onto specific levels. Try N=5, 7, 11
                   for distinctly "digital" feel.

  Recipe 2 — "Subtle texture"
    Family:        hypo
    Points:        64
    Projection:    radius
    Dedup:         off
    Use case:      Many levels means snap differences are tiny. Adds
                   subtle quantization "tooth" without changing the
                   overall stroke shape. Useful for taking the edge off
                   over-smooth signals.

  Recipe 3 — "Flower clustering"
    Family:        rose
    Params:        a=1, k=5
    Points:        40
    Projection:    radius
    Use case:      Rose curves cluster levels near 0 (most petals are
                   short) with a few peaks. Strokes spend most time near
                   low positions with occasional reaches to specific
                   higher levels. Sounds esoteric — try it.

  Recipe 4 — "Asymmetric Lissajous"
    Family:        lissajous
    Params:        A=1, B=1, a=5, b=3, delta=1.0
    Projection:    y
    Points:        32
    Use case:      Y-projection of an asymmetric Lissajous makes a
                   noticeably non-uniform level grid. Combined with
                   dedup, gives uneven "rhythm" to held positions.

  Recipe 5 — "Butterfly with custom levels"
    Family:        butterfly
    Params:        scale=1.0
    Projection:    radius
    Points:        48
    Dedup:         on
    Use case:      Many duplicate levels collapse to a smaller unique
                   set; preview will show e.g. "32 unique". Wide sample
                   reduction after dedup. Organic-feeling steps.

  Recipe 6 — "Custom signature"
    Family:        custom
    x(t):          sin(t) * (1 + 0.4*sin(7*t))
    y(t):          cos(t) * (1 + 0.4*sin(7*t))
    Projection:    radius
    Points:        23
    Use case:      A 7-fold-symmetric flower. Levels cluster at the
                   inner radius with seven distinct peaks. Substitute
                   the 7 with another small odd number for more/fewer
                   accent levels.

CONFIG STORAGE

  Saved under "trochoid_quantization" in config.json:
    enabled               bool
    n_points              int
    projection            "radius" | "y" | "x"
    family                e.g. "hypo", "rose", "butterfly", ...
    deduplicate_holds     bool
    params_by_family      {family_name: {param: value, ...}, ...}

  Per-family params are stored separately so switching family doesn't
  lose values. The legacy flat keys (curve_type, R, r, d) from earlier
  versions are auto-migrated into params_by_family on first load.

NOTE ON DENSIFICATION

  Unlike Trochoid Spatial (section 14) and Traveling Wave (section 15),
  Trochoid Quantization does NOT resample the output to a denser grid.
  It's a snap-to-level transform: each input sample maps to the nearest
  level, preserving the input's timing exactly. Densifying would just
  add redundant hold samples without changing the information — the
  discrete stair-step is the whole point.

================================================================================
14. TROCHOID SPATIAL TAB — CURVE-DRIVEN E1-E4
================================================================================

A second way to use parametric curves with the E1-E4 system. Where the
"Trochoid" tab (section 13) SNAPS the INPUT signal to discrete curve-derived
levels, this tab uses the curve geometry directly to DRIVE the four
electrodes — each electrode represents a compass direction, and the
2D curve point determines how loud each electrode is at any moment.

When enabled, this OVERRIDES the response-curve E1-E4 generation in the
Motion Axis (4P) tab. The .e1/.e2/.e3/.e4 funscripts that the processor
writes will come from this spatial mapping instead of from per-axis
response curves.

CONCEPTUAL MODEL

Imagine four electrodes arranged in a circle around you:

           E2 (90°)
              |
   E3 (180°) -+- E1 (0°)
              |
           E4 (270°)

Now imagine a moving point — the "pen" of a Spirograph. As input position
sweeps from 0 to 1, the pen traces along the chosen 2D curve (hypotrochoid,
rose, butterfly, ...). At each moment, the pen has a position (x, y) in
the plane. We compute "how much" each electrode should fire from the
relationship between the pen's position and that electrode's compass
direction. As the pen orbits, the sensation moves around the four
electrodes — like a virtual stim spot dancing through space.

Different curves produce dramatically different motion patterns. A simple
hypotrochoid traces a closed flower; a rose curve sweeps in/out through
petals; a butterfly traces an organic, asymmetric path. Each yields a
unique spatial sensation pattern.

THE CONTROLS

  Enable trochoid-spatial E1-E4 generation
    Master toggle. When on, the processor uses the spatial mapping for
    .e1/.e2/.e3/.e4 instead of running each axis through its response
    curve. Default OFF.

  Curve family
    Same family list as the Trochoid tab — hypo, epi, rose, lissajous,
    butterfly, superformula, custom. The chosen curve provides the
    pen's path. See section 13 for full equations and parameter meaning.

  Mapping        directional | distance | amplitude
    How the pen position becomes per-electrode intensity. See "Mapping
    modes" below for the math and feel of each.

  Sharpness        ≥ 0.01, default 1.0
    Cosine exponent applied in directional and amplitude modes. Higher
    sharpness = more selective; the electrode lights only when the pen
    points nearly straight at it.
      0.5 — very soft, broad activation; multiple electrodes fire at once
      1.0 — natural cosine; smooth transitions
      2.0 — moderate selectivity
      4.0 — sharp; each electrode fires only in its narrow direction
      8.0 — laser-focused; near-binary on/off

  Cycles per stroke        default 1.0
    How many full curve traversals happen per 0→1 input change. Controls
    how quickly the pen orbits as the input sweeps.
      0.5 — slow; one stroke covers half the curve, sensation drifts
      1.0 — natural; one stroke = one full curve trace
      3.0 — busy; one stroke triggers three full orbits, fast electrode flicker
      10.0 — frantic; near-buzzing rotation per stroke

  Electrode angles (E1, E2, E3, E4) in degrees
    Compass positions of the four electrodes. Default 0/90/180/270 — a
    cardinal layout (E1=East, E2=North, E3=West, E4=South). Edit to
    rotate the whole layout (e.g. 45/135/225/315 for diagonals) or to
    cluster electrodes (e.g. 0/30/60/90 to bias activation toward one
    quadrant).

  Family parameters (R, r, d / a, k / etc.)
    Same per-family curve parameters as the Trochoid tab (section 13),
    with short inline hints and hover tooltips.

MAPPING MODES — THE MATH

For each input sample p ∈ [0, 1]:
  1. Compute t = theta_max × cycles_per_stroke × p
     (theta_max is the family's natural sweep range — 2π for most,
     12π for butterfly)
  2. Evaluate the curve at t to get (x, y)
  3. Normalize the curve into a unit-radius reference so the math is
     comparable across families: x_n = x / r_max, y_n = y / r_max,
     where r_max is the curve's maximum radius.
  4. For each electrode at compass angle θ_k, compute intensity i_k
     using the chosen mapping rule:

  ── DIRECTIONAL (default) ──────────────────────────────────────
    angle = atan2(y_n, x_n)               # angle of pen from origin
    i_k   = max(0, cos(angle - θ_k)) ^ sharpness

    What you feel: as the pen orbits the origin, the sensation rotates
    around the electrode array. Each electrode lights up when the pen
    is "in its direction". With sharpness=1, two adjacent electrodes
    overlap (smooth fade between them). With sharpness=4+, only the
    electrode directly aligned with the pen fires strongly.

    Best for: rose curves, pentagram-like hypotrochoids, anything with
    clear directional reach. The sensation feels like a moving spot
    of focus traversing the array.

  ── DISTANCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    For each electrode, place it at (cos(θ_k), sin(θ_k)) on the unit
    circle.
    d   = ‖(x_n, y_n) − (cos(θ_k), sin(θ_k))‖
    i_k = max(0, 1 − d/2) ^ sharpness

    What you feel: each electrode lights up when the pen physically
    approaches its position on the unit circle. Unlike directional,
    this rewards both correct angle AND proximity (radius matters).
    Pen at origin → all electrodes equally "1 unit away" → similar
    medium intensities. Pen pushed out toward an electrode → that
    one peaks while opposites stay dark.

    Best for: curves that loiter at specific radii. Rose curves with
    distance mapping concentrate energy at the petal tips. Lissajous
    figures highlight the lattice intersections.

  ── AMPLITUDE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    angle = atan2(y_n, x_n)
    r_n   = ‖(x_n, y_n)‖              # normalized radius
    i_k   = r_n × max(0, cos(angle - θ_k)) ^ sharpness

    Combination of directional + radius weighting. Even when the pen
    is pointing toward an electrode, intensity is scaled down if the
    pen is near origin.

    What you feel: the rotating sensation of directional, but with
    intensity that "breathes" — strongest at the curve's outer
    extremes, quieter when the curve passes near center. Adds a
    natural emphasis to peaks of motion.

    Best for: emphasizing the dramatic moments of complex curves.
    Butterfly + amplitude shows when the pen reaches the wing tips.

LIVE PREVIEW — THREE PANELS

  Top-left: 2D curve geometry
    The full curve, with the four electrode positions marked as
    colored dots on the unit circle (E1 blue, E2 orange, E3 green,
    E4 red). A dashed grey unit circle is drawn for reference.

  Top-right: Intensity vs input position
    Four lines (one per electrode) showing how each electrode's
    intensity varies as input sweeps 0 → 1. This is the "channel
    response" — exactly what each electrode will do in response to
    a smooth input ramp. Useful for tuning sharpness and cycles:
    you'll see the activation patterns directly.

  Bottom: Time-domain preview
    Using the loaded input file (or a synthetic sine if no file is
    loaded), shows what the input signal looks like (faint grey)
    and what each electrode would do over time (colored lines).
    This is the closest visual approximation of what the device
    will receive.

All three panels refresh live as you change family, mapping, sharpness,
cycles, electrode angles, or family parameters. Changes also propagate
to the Motion Axis (4P) Waveform Preview, so you can see the override
in context with the source signal.

TROCHOID vs TROCHOID SPATIAL — WHEN TO USE WHICH

  Trochoid Quantization (section 13):
    - Snaps the INPUT signal to N discrete curve-derived levels
    - Affects EVERYTHING downstream (alpha/beta, E1-E4, frequency,
      volume, pulse) because all those derive from the snapped main
    - Best for: "mechanical lock" feel; rhythmic, stepped motion;
      forcing position into specific rungs

  Trochoid Spatial (section 14):
    - Replaces the E1-E4 derivation entirely
    - Doesn't change the input signal — alpha/beta and other
      derivations work from the original main funscript
    - Best for: "rotating sensation" feel; spatial choreography
      across the four electrodes; making complex curve geometry
      directly drive the pattern

  Both can be on at the same time:
    - Quantization snaps the input first
    - Spatial then maps the (snapped) input through the curve
      geometry to produce E1-E4
    - Result: discrete-level rotation through the spatial pattern

USAGE RECIPES

  Recipe 1 — "Rotating spotlight" (smooth orbit)
    Family:    rose, a=1, k=5
    Mapping:   directional
    Sharpness: 2.0
    Cycles:    1.0
    Use case:  As input sweeps a stroke, the sensation rotates once
               around the electrode array, visiting each electrode in
               turn. Smooth and clearly perceptible directional motion.

  Recipe 2 — "Petal punch" (focused peaks)
    Family:    rose, a=1, k=5
    Mapping:   distance
    Sharpness: 4.0
    Cycles:    1.0
    Use case:  Each rose petal reaches toward a specific compass
               direction; only the matching electrode lights up at
               the petal tip. Five distinct "punches" per stroke.

  Recipe 3 — "Hypotrochoid orbit" (multi-loop dance)
    Family:    hypo, R=5, r=3, d=2
    Mapping:   directional
    Sharpness: 2.5
    Cycles:    1.0
    Use case:  Complex orbital motion; the pen dances through several
               internal loops per stroke, lighting electrodes in
               non-trivial sequences.

  Recipe 4 — "Butterfly wings" (asymmetric reach)
    Family:    butterfly, scale=1.0
    Mapping:   amplitude
    Sharpness: 3.0
    Cycles:    0.5
    Use case:  The butterfly traces wings reaching out at specific
               angles. Amplitude mode emphasizes the wing-tip moments,
               so the sensation surges when the pen reaches its
               extremes. Half-cycle covers the curve over a stroke.

  Recipe 5 — "Fast cardinal flicker"
    Family:    hypo or any
    Mapping:   directional
    Sharpness: 6.0
    Cycles:    8.0
    Use case:  Each input stroke triggers many full curve traversals,
               and high sharpness ensures only one electrode at a time.
               Result: rapid sequential firing across electrodes —
               feels like a circular buzz.

  Recipe 6 — "Diagonal layout"
    Family:    hypo, default
    Mapping:   directional
    Sharpness: 1.5
    Electrode angles: 45 / 135 / 225 / 315
    Use case:  Same hypotrochoid pattern but rotated 45° — useful when
               your physical electrode mounting is diagonal rather than
               cardinal. The pattern feel rotates with the layout.

  Recipe 7 — "Custom expression"
    Family:    custom
    x(t) = sin(t) * (1 + 0.4*cos(7*t))
    y(t) = cos(t) * (1 + 0.4*cos(7*t))
    Mapping:   amplitude
    Sharpness: 3.0
    Cycles:    1.0
    Use case:  A 7-fold flower with seven distinct directional surges
               per stroke. Substitute the 7 with another small odd
               number for more/fewer accent moments.

CONFIG STORAGE

    params_by_family     {family_name: {param: value, ...}, ...}

Per-family params are stored separately so switching family doesn't
lose values.

OUTPUT DENSIFICATION

  `generate_spatial_funscripts` linearly resamples the input to
  60 Hz before evaluating the curve mapping, then writes the dense
  output files. This matters for curves with many lobes or high
  `cycles_per_unit` values: between two sparse input samples (typical
  funscripts run 8-30 Hz) the curve can traverse significant arc,
  producing intensity variation that would otherwise be aliased
  away. Without densification a rose(k=5, cycles=4) mapped through
  an 8 Hz funscript can come out visually identical to the input.
  With 60 Hz densification, the per-lobe detail is preserved in the
  saved .e1-.e4 files. Pass `densify_hz=0` to the API for the old
  behavior.

NOTES

  - When trochoid_spatial.enabled is true, the response-curve motion
    axis generation in the Motion Axis (4P) tab is SKIPPED. You don't
    need to disable axes in that tab — the spatial generation produces
    all four files unconditionally.
  - The spatial mapping does NOT touch alpha/beta, frequency, volume,
    pulse, or the prostate channels. Those are still derived from the
    (possibly trochoid-quantized) main funscript via the standard
    pipeline. Only the four .e1/.e2/.e3/.e4 files come from the
    spatial mapping.
  - The Animation Viewer has a "Spatial" toggle in its Show panel that
    switches the live trajectory/bars/dimmer between the response-curve
    view and the spatial-mapping view. Defaults to whatever the global
    config has when the viewer is opened.

================================================================================
15. TRAVELING WAVE TAB — LINEAR/AXIAL E1-E4
================================================================================

A THIRD E1-E4 generator, alongside the response-curve Motion Axis (4P)
and Trochoid Spatial. Where the others are either per-axis curves
(section 7) or a 2D radial projection onto compass-angle electrodes
(section 14), Traveling Wave treats the four electrodes as LINEAR
POSITIONS ALONG A SHAFT and moves a wave crest along that shaft at
its own clock. Each electrode fires when the crest passes close to
its position.

When Traveling Wave is enabled it takes the HIGHEST PRIORITY in the
processor — both Trochoid Spatial and the Motion Axis response curves
are skipped for E1-E4.

HOW THE WAVE WORKS

  For each electrode at shaft position p_i in [0, 1]:

      intensity_i(t) = envelope(t) · max(0, 1 − |crest_pos(t) − p_i|
                                               / wave_width) ^ sharpness

  The crest advances along the shaft independently of the input
  signal. The input y modulates the envelope (amplitude) and can
  optionally modulate the wave speed.

PARAMETERS

  Enable traveling-wave E1-E4 generation
    Master toggle. When on, writes e1-e4 from this model and skips
    spatial + response-curve paths.

  Direction
    How the crest moves along the shaft.
      one_way_up        Always base → tip, wrapping at the tip.
      one_way_down      Always tip → base, wrapping at the base.
      bounce            Ping-pongs between base and tip.
      signal_direction  Crest moves base → tip on up-strokes of the
                        input signal and tip → base on down-strokes.
                        The direction flips with the sign of the
                        input's smoothed derivative.
      signal_position   Crest IS the input signal — crest_pos(t) =
                        y(t). The "wave" becomes a position-driven
                        spotlight that lights whichever electrode
                        the signal is currently closest to. Tightest
                        funscript sync available; wave_speed_hz and
                        speed_mod are ignored in this mode. Width and
                        sharpness still control the kernel shape.

  Envelope
    How the input y modulates the crest's amplitude.
      constant     Envelope = 1 always. Pure wave regardless of
                   input. Use for continuous pulse patterns.
      input        Envelope = y(t). Amplitude tracks the input.
                   Wave dies at y=0, full at y=1.
      input_speed  Envelope = |dy/dt| normalized to its 95th
                   percentile. Wave fires during motion, silent
                   when held. Great for speed-driven sensations.
      abs_center   Envelope = 2 · |y − 0.5|. Peaks at the extremes
                   (y=0 or y=1), silent at mid-stroke.

  Wave speed (Hz)
    Full-shaft traversals per second. 1.0 Hz = one base-to-tip
    traversal per second. 3 Hz = three per second (fast buzz).

  Wave width
    Half-width of the triangular kernel in shaft units [0-1].
    Smaller = sharper, more localized "zap" as the crest passes.
    Larger = broader overlap, multiple electrodes fire at once.
    Default 0.18.

  Speed modulation
    How much the input modulates the effective wave speed:
        effective_speed = wave_speed · (1 + speed_mod · (y − 0.5))
    0 = constant speed (default). 1.0 = wave runs half-speed at y=0
    and 1.5x speed at y=1. Useful for "faster wave on deep strokes".

  Sharpness
    Exponent applied to the triangular kernel. 1 = linear triangle.
    Higher values narrow the peak and flatten the skirts — each
    electrode fires only when the crest is directly on it.

  Noise gate (0 - 0.5)
    Soft-threshold applied to each electrode's intensity AFTER the
    kernel. Values at or below the gate are zeroed; the remaining
    (gate, 1] range is linearly rescaled to [0, 1] so peaks still
    reach full amplitude. This is the simplest way to drop the
    noise floor — the low-level residual activation from kernel
    skirts and never-quite-zero envelopes — without re-tuning
    width/sharpness.
      0.00  disabled (raw output)
      0.10  default; kills skirt fuzz, keeps soft edges
      0.25  crisp on/off behavior
      0.40+ aggressive; only strong hits fire at all

  Exclusive (winner-take-all)
    Checkbox. When on, at each sample only the electrode with the
    HIGHEST intensity keeps its value; the other three are zeroed.
    Combined with a narrow wave_width and signal_position direction,
    this gives a clean "one electrode at a time" spotlight that
    hops as the signal sweeps past each position.

  Electrode positions (E1-E4)
    Shaft positions in [0, 1]. Default: E1=0.85 (near tip),
    descending to E4=0.25 (near base). Adjustable per device
    layout.

PER-AXIS MODULATION APPLIES

  The per-axis modulation block from the Motion Axis (4P) tab
  (section 9) applies here too. When an axis has modulation
  enabled, its traveling-wave output is passed through the same
  `apply_modulation()` LFO: the intensity envelope shrinks into
  [depth, 1-depth] and a sine at frequency_hz is added. This lets
  you overlay per-electrode textures on top of the wave — e.g.,
  8 Hz wobble on E2, 16 Hz wobble on E4.

RECIPES

  "Gentle continuous sweep"
    direction=bounce, envelope=constant, wave_speed=0.5 Hz,
    width=0.25, speed_mod=0, sharpness=1
    → Slow overlapping rollover across all electrodes, independent
    of input. Use for baseline presence.

  "Signal-following zap"
    direction=signal_direction, envelope=input, speed=3 Hz,
    width=0.08, speed_mod=0, sharpness=2
    → Sharp crest that moves with stroke direction. Feels like
    the sensation follows your motion.

  "Speed-responsive wave"
    direction=bounce, envelope=input_speed, speed=1 Hz, width=0.2,
    speed_mod=1.0, sharpness=1
    → Wave amplitude tracks how fast you're stroking, and the wave
    speeds up on deep strokes.

  "Clean spotlight" (uses signal_position + exclusive)
    direction=signal_position, envelope=constant, width=0.12,
    sharpness=2, noise_gate=0.15, exclusive=true
    → Only one electrode fires at a time, and only the one the
    funscript's y value is currently over. Speed/speed_mod are
    ignored in this direction mode. Crisp, discrete, 1-of-4 feel.

  "Quiet floor" (noise-gate demo on a smooth wave)
    direction=bounce, envelope=input, speed=1 Hz, width=0.22,
    sharpness=1.5, noise_gate=0.25
    → Same smooth traveling wave, but the kernel skirts are killed.
    Electrodes only fire when the crest is genuinely close, giving
    visibly punchier transitions between them.

OUTPUT DENSIFICATION

  `generate_wave_funscripts` linearly resamples the input to 60 Hz
  before running the wave model, then writes the dense intensity
  arrays. Without this, a typical sparse funscript (8-30 pts/sec)
  would alias out most of the wave's motion — a 4 Hz crest sampled
  at 8 Hz can end up as flat zero because every input timestamp
  happens to fall in the wave's trough. At 60 Hz the crest's full
  trajectory is captured in the saved .e1-.e4 files. Pass
  `densify_hz=0` to the API to disable.

CONFIG KEYS

Saved under "traveling_wave" in config.json:
  enabled, direction, envelope_mode, wave_speed_hz, wave_width,
  speed_mod, sharpness, velocity_window_s, noise_gate, exclusive,
  electrode_positions.

OVERRIDE PRIORITY SUMMARY (HIGHEST → LOWEST)

  1. Traveling Wave     — linear/axial crest model
  2. Trochoid Spatial   — radial/angular 2D projection
  3. Motion Axis (4P)   — per-axis response curves

Only the highest-enabled path runs for E1-E4. Everything else
(alpha/beta, frequency, volume, pulse) is unaffected.

16. COMPARISON VIEWER (COMPARE FUNSCRIPTS)
================================================================================

A standalone comparison tool for viewing two funscripts side by side
(or overlaid) with synchronized scrolling, a draggable playhead, and
an optional difference panel. Useful for:
  - Comparing original input vs processed output
  - Comparing two different processing settings (A/B test)
  - Spotting drift, alignment differences, or quantization effects
  - Cross-checking that a saved/loaded file matches expectations

LAUNCH

  In-app:    Click the "Compare Funscripts" button in the bottom button
             row of the main window. The currently-selected input file
             is pre-loaded into slot A; use Browse to add a slot B file.

  Standalone: From the project folder, run
                  python funscript_compare.py
              Or with one or both files pre-loaded:
                  python funscript_compare.py file_a.funscript
                  python funscript_compare.py file_a.funscript file_b.funscript

  In either case the viewer runs in the same Python process — no
  significant startup overhead, no extra interpreter spinup.

THE TIMELINES

  Each plot shows position 0–100 over time, filled-area styling.
  File A is blue, File B is red. They share the X (time) axis, so
  zooming or panning one moves the other in lockstep.

  Above each plot, the file path and a summary appear:
      file.funscript — 1234 samples | 120.50 s

OVERLAY MODE (checkbox)

  Off (default): two stacked timelines.
  On: both signals collapse into a single subplot, with file A in blue
  and file B in red. Best for inspecting alignment — drift between the
  two signals becomes immediately visible.

DIFFERENCE PANEL (checkbox)

  Off (default): no difference panel.
  On: a third panel appears at the bottom showing (B − A) over time.
  Both signals are resampled to a common dense grid covering only the
  time range where both files exist. The panel title shows:
    Difference — RMS XX.XX | peak XX.XX
  RMS = root-mean-square of the difference (overall drift magnitude).
  peak = maximum absolute difference (biggest single-sample divergence).

  Useful for measuring how much processing changed the signal, or
  detecting that two "identical" files actually differ.

MOUSE INTERACTIONS

  Within any signal subplot:

  Left-click            Set the playhead at that time. The playhead
                        readout shows  "1.234 s   A=68.5   B=72.3"
                        (raw and B values at that moment).
  Left-click + drag     Pan the view horizontally. The other timelines
                        follow because they share the X axis. Light-
                        weight (set_xlim only) so it stays smooth on
                        long files.
  Scroll-wheel up       Zoom in, anchored on the cursor's time position
                        (the time under the cursor stays put).
  Scroll-wheel down     Zoom out, also cursor-anchored.
  Right-click           Clear the playhead.

  Buttons:
    Fit                 Reset the view to span all loaded data.
    Clear playhead      Removes the green vertical playhead line.
    Swap A↔B            Swap the two slots without re-browsing.

THE SCRUBBER (TIMELINE SLIDER)

  A horizontal slider below the canvas covers the entire loaded
  duration. Drag it to move the playhead through the file at any
  speed. The current scrubber position appears next to it as
  "12.345 s".

  Follow scrub (checkbox)
    On (default): if the playhead would scroll outside the visible
    window during a drag, the view re-centers on it so you stay
    focused on the playhead even at high zoom.
    Off: the playhead can scrub off-screen and the view stays put —
    useful when you're inspecting one zoomed region and want to see
    A/B values at faraway timestamps without losing your zoom.

  Clicking on a plot also updates the scrubber automatically — the
  slider always reflects the current playhead position.

VIEW READOUT

  Just above the playhead readout, the current visible time range
  appears as "0.000 → 120.000 s". Updates live as you pan or zoom.

PERFORMANCE NOTES

  - Toplevel popup (when launched from the main app) — no separate
    process, no startup penalty.
  - Pan and zoom use lightweight set_xlim + draw_idle, not full figure
    rebuilds. Stays smooth on multi-hour files.
  - Difference panel resamples to ≤20,000 points (capped) — bounded
    cost regardless of input length.
  - The figure is only rebuilt when overlay/difference toggles change
    or files are loaded.

17. SHAFT VIEWER — HORIZONTAL CYLINDER + SYNCED VIDEO
================================================================================

A physical model of a cylindrical shaft with E1-E4 arranged linearly
along its length. A red dot slides horizontally tracking the current
signal position, each electrode pulses with its current intensity,
and an optional video panel above the shaft plays in sync with the
signal. Launch from the "Shaft Viewer" button in the main app's bottom
button row.

Default orientation: E1 at 0.85 (near the tip/right), descending to
E4 at 0.25 (near the base/left). All four positions are adjustable
with sliders below the canvas.

ELECTRODE POSITIONS

Four sliders + numeric entries, one per electrode, in the range
[0, 1] along the shaft. 0 = base (LEFT in the horizontal view), 1 =
tip (RIGHT). Defaults: E1=0.85, E2=0.65, E3=0.45, E4=0.25 — E1 closest
to the tip, descending to E4 at the base.

Drag any slider and the band, intensity bar, and label positions
update live. Positions can be set to match your device's actual
electrode layout; common configurations:

    Evenly spaced (full length):  E1=0.85 / E2=0.65 / E3=0.45 / E4=0.25
    Tip-clustered:                E1=0.90 / E2=0.80 / E3=0.70 / E4=0.60
    Base-clustered:               E1=0.40 / E2=0.30 / E3=0.20 / E4=0.10

INTENSITY SOURCE

The dropdown "Intensity mode" selects how per-electrode intensity is
computed at each moment. Six options:

    auto        Priority-resolve using the current config:
                  1. Traveling wave (if enabled)
                  2. Trochoid-spatial mapping (if enabled)
                  3. Response curves (if Motion Axis 4P on)
                  4. Saved .e1-.e4 files (if they exist on disk)
                  5. Proximity model
    wave        Force the traveling-wave linear/axial driver. See
                section 15.
    spatial     Force the trochoid-spatial radial projection (curve
                parameterized by input, projected onto electrode
                angles). See section 14.
    curves      Force the per-axis response-curve E1-E4 from the
                Motion Axis (4P) tab.
    files       Force reading from saved .e1/.e2/.e3/.e4 funscripts
                (if they exist next to the source file).
    proximity   Geometric model only: intensity = max(0, 1 − |pos −
                electrode_pos| / reach). Ignores all processing.

"Apply trochoid quantization" checkbox snaps the main signal to N
curve-derived levels BEFORE computing E1-E4 (regardless of the
intensity mode). Defaults to whatever the global config has.

The "Intensity" summary line above the canvas always states what's
active, e.g. "Intensity: Trochoid Spatial (rose, directional) +
trochoid quantization".

REFRESH BUTTON

Re-reads the main window's current_config and recomputes the per-sample
E1-E4 intensity arrays. Click after changing settings in the Trochoid,
Trochoid Spatial, or Traveling Wave tabs to see the update in the
viewer.

SHOW VIDEO TOGGLE

A checkbox in the top control row. Default is OFF — the synced-video
panel spins up a cv2 VideoCapture and per-tick decode, which isn't
needed for most shaft-visualization work. Tick it to reveal the
video panel and load a file; untick to hide and skip decode.

When off, the video panel is hidden (removed from the layout — the
shaft canvas grows to fill the freed space). Loaded video state is
preserved while hidden: toggling back on resumes playback from
exactly where it was, with the same file/offset. While hidden, the
video frame decoder is skipped every tick for a real CPU saving.

PROXIMITY REACH

Slider + numeric readout, range 0.02–0.50, only relevant in proximity
mode (or when no spatial/curves config is active). Smaller = each
electrode fires only when the dot is very close to its position;
larger = broad overlapping activation across electrodes.

VIDEO PLAYBACK

Optional synced video. Three ways to load a video:

    1. Drop a video file onto the black panel at the top of the window
       (.mp4 / .mov / .mkv / .m4v / .avi / .webm supported via opencv).
    2. Click the "Browse…" button in the bottom controls.
    3. Automatically — when the viewer opens with a funscript loaded,
       it looks for a video file with a matching base name next to the
       funscript. E.g. `scene.funscript` + `scene.mp4` in the same
       folder loads the video automatically.

Frames are read via opencv-python and displayed with Pillow (ImageTk).
Requires both libraries; if either is missing, the video panel shows
"Video playback unavailable — install opencv-python + Pillow" and the
rest of the viewer works normally.

SYNC CONTROLS

Even with matched filenames, the video and signal sometimes start at
different reference points (a funscript with a 2 s lead-in vs a raw
video starting from frame 0 is common). Three controls handle this:

    Offset (s)    Spinbox with 0.05 s increments (or type any value,
                  press Enter). The video time for any given signal
                  time is computed as:
                      video_t = signal_t + offset
                  Positive offset = video is advanced relative to
                  signal. Negative offset = video is delayed.
    Sync here     Click this after manually aligning signal and video
                  (e.g., scrubbing to a distinctive moment and tweaking
                  the offset until they line up visually). The button
                  reads the actual current video position and sets
                  offset = actual_video_time − signal_time so subsequent
                  playback honors that alignment.
    Clear         Releases the loaded video and returns the black
                  placeholder.

Video frames are primed BEFORE playback starts (clicking ▶ Play forces
an immediate video update, so the first frame is visible before the
dot begins moving). Frame seeking is throttled to avoid re-reading
the same frame — seeks only occur when the time drift exceeds half a
video frame.

Note on seek accuracy: opencv's `CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC` seeks to the
nearest keyframe for most codecs. On heavily-compressed content you
may see ±0.5 s granularity. H.264 MP4s from most sources are keyframe-
dense enough that this is negligible.

PLAYBACK CONTROLS

    ▶ Play / ⏸ Pause   Autonomous playback; rate set by the FPS
                        spinner (default 24, configurable 5-60).
    Scrubber           Drag to jump; stays synced with playback.

    Speed              0.25x / 0.5x / 1x / 2x / 4x (combobox).
    FPS                Preview tick rate. 24 (cinematic default)
                        gives ~42 ms per-tick budget for the
                        matplotlib redraw + video frame fetch.
                        Raise for smoother visuals (more CPU);
                        lower (15-20) for more headroom against
                        Tk preemption. Persists via
                        config['ui']['shaft_viewer_fps'].
    Loops              Automatically loops from the end back to start.

The same scrubber drag updates the dot, the electrode intensity bars
AND the video frame in lockstep — useful for frame-accurate
inspection.

Note: a dt_wall cap inside the tick loop clamps the per-tick
playhead advance to 1.5× the nominal frame interval. If a tick is
preempted (e.g. a ttk.Combobox dropdown blocks the Tk main thread
for 100-200 ms on macOS), the playhead slows briefly instead of
leaping forward — so preemption shows up as a one-frame slow-mo
blip rather than a visible jump/stutter.

18. TROCHOID VIEWER — 2D CURVE + SHAFT SHADOW / LOBES
================================================================================

A focused viewer that pairs the 2D trochoid curve with its
"shadow" on the shaft. Launch from the "Trochoid Viewer" button
in the main app's bottom button row. Unlike the Shaft Viewer
(which shows a dot tracking the raw signal), this viewer shows
how a CHOSEN TROCHOID transforms the signal into a shaft
position — useful for previewing and A/B-ing trochoid curves.

LEFT PANEL — 2D TROCHOID

The full curve (from the selected family) is drawn as a faint
reference. A red pen dot traces along it, driven by:

    theta = (y(t) · theta_max · cycles) mod theta_max

As y sweeps 0 → 1, the pen sweeps the whole curve once (more
times if Cycles > 1). A short red trail shows the last 0.6 s
of motion. Unit-circle reference drawn as a dashed grey ring.

RIGHT PANEL — SHAFT (TWO DISPLAY MODES)

Shadow mode (default):
    The pen's (x, y) is projected to a scalar via the Projection
    selector (x, y, or radius), then normalized to [0, 1] using
    the dense curve's min/max. That's the shadow's shaft position.
    A red marker on the shaft tracks the shadow, with a fading
    trail behind it.

Lobes mode:
    Peaks of the selected projection are detected with a ≥ 8%
    prominence threshold. Each peak is a "lobe" and gets an equal
    slice of shaft [0, 1]. Bars are drawn with height = peak's
    projection value and viridis coloring. A red outline highlights
    the currently-active lobe (the one containing the pen's theta).
    Lobe count = visual petal count for most curves — e.g. rose
    k=5 with projection=y gives 5 lobes.

ELECTRODE INTENSITY (VIEWER-LOCAL)

A simple proximity falloff:
    intensity_i = max(0, 1 − |shadow_x − p_i| / reach)
The "Proximity reach" slider controls the falloff width. In lobes
mode the active lobe's center is used as the shadow for this
calculation. Note: this is a SIMPLIFIED VIEWER MODEL — it is NOT
what the processor writes to the .e1-.e4 files. For accurate
per-electrode outputs, enable Trochoid Spatial (section 14) or
Traveling Wave (section 15) and process.

CURVE PARAMETERS

The per-family `R`, `r`, `d`, `a`, `k`, etc. come from
`trochoid_spatial.params_by_family` in config.json at viewer-open
time. Edit them via the Trochoid Spatial tab (section 14), then
reopen the viewer to see the reshape. (Live parameter editing in
the viewer is not yet exposed.)

CONFIG SOURCES

  Family + params      trochoid_spatial.family + params_by_family
                       (fallback to trochoid_quantization)
  Cycles default       trochoid_spatial.cycles_per_unit
  Electrode positions  traveling_wave.electrode_positions
                       (fallback to viewer defaults)

The viewer does NOT write back to config — tuning in the viewer
is display-only. To persist changes, edit the respective tabs
in the main UI.

================================================================================
19. VARIANTS (A/B/C/D WHOLE-CONFIG SNAPSHOTS)
================================================================================

A compact top-level bar sits above the parameter tabs:

    Variants:  Active: [●A  ○B  ○C  ○D]    Enabled: [☑A ☐B ☐C ☐D]
               [Save current to active slot]  [Process all enabled variants]

Each slot (A/B/C/D) stores a COMPLETE snapshot of every tab's
settings — general/speed/frequency/volume/pulse/motion-axis/trochoid/
trochoid-spatial/traveling-wave/everything. Picking a different slot
swaps the whole config at once; no per-tab work, no lost edits.

BEHAVIOR

  Switching active slot:
    - The current UI state is auto-saved into the slot you're LEAVING.
    - The new slot's snapshot is loaded into every tab via
      update_display(). If the target slot has never been populated,
      it inherits the current config on first switch.
    - This is the fast iteration loop: set up a config in A, flip to
      B, reshape, flip to C, etc. All four live side-by-side.

  Save current to active slot:
    Explicit snapshot. Use when you want to commit the exact current
    state to the active slot without switching away first.

  Enabled checkboxes:
    Pick which slots get included when you click "Process all enabled".
    The active slot is always included if its box is checked.

  Process all enabled variants:
    Loops over the enabled slots, running the full processor once
    per variant. Each variant's outputs go to their own subfolder:

        <input_dir>/<basename>_variants/A/<basename>.e1.funscript
        <input_dir>/<basename>_variants/A/<basename>.e2.funscript
        <input_dir>/<basename>_variants/A/<basename>.alpha.funscript
        ...
        <input_dir>/<basename>_variants/B/<basename>.e1.funscript
        ...
        <input_dir>/<basename>_variants/C/...

    Restim loads files by matching basename in a folder — point it at
    one subfolder at a time to audition that variant. No filename
    collisions, no renaming.

  Runs sequentially (one variant at a time), same thread model as
  regular processing. Four variants take ~4x a single run's wall time.

WORKFLOW

  1. Configure slot A normally. Process once to confirm it works.
  2. Click B in the Active group. The UI inherits A's config. Tweak
     anything you want to compare (e.g. different trochoid family,
     noise_gate, wave direction, curve choice, etc.).
  3. Repeat for C and D. Tick the Enabled boxes for every slot you
     want to render.
  4. Click "Process all enabled variants".
  5. Point restim at <basename>_variants/A/, test; then /B/, test; etc.
  6. Iterate on the ones you like; re-run.

RESET TO DEFAULTS

  The "Reset to Defaults" button at the bottom of the main window
  is untouched by the variants system. Clicking it resets the CURRENT
  (active) slot's config back to defaults so you can start fresh on
  a new file. Other slots are left intact. Use this when you load a
  new file and want a clean slate while keeping your A/B/C/D work
  for later.

CONFIG STORAGE

  Saved under "variants" in config.json:
    active    "A" | "B" | "C" | "D"
    slots     { "A": {label, enabled, config: {...}},
                "B": {label, enabled, config: {...}},
                ... }

  Each slot's "config" is a FULL snapshot of every other top-level
  config section, minus the "variants" block itself (so it doesn't
  recursively nest). Empty config dict = not yet populated (inherits
  on first switch).

NOTES

  - Variants DO NOT affect the normal single-run "Process All Files"
    or "Process Motion Files" buttons. Those always use the currently
    active slot's settings and write to the normal output location.
  - Saving the config (Save Config / Save Preset) persists the whole
    variants block to disk, so your A/B/C/D survive restarts.
  - The custom_output_directory setting is temporarily overridden
    during a "Process all enabled" run to point at the per-variant
    subfolder; the active slot's persistent setting is not modified.

20. UI CONVENTIONS (TWO-ROW TABS, SCROLL ANYWHERE)
================================================================================

The parameter tabs above the main canvas (General / Speed / Frequency /
Volume / Pulse / Motion Axis 3P / Motion Axis 4P / Advanced / Trochoid /
Trochoid Spatial / Traveling Wave / Signal Gen) are arranged in two rows of up to six
buttons each, so all of them stay visible without a horizontal scroll
or a hidden-overflow chevron. Click any button to switch to that tab —
the currently-selected tab is visually "pressed" (sunken).

The tab bar auto-wraps based on a six-per-row limit. If tabs are added
in the future the bar grows to a third row as needed.

MOUSE-WHEEL SCROLLING

Every parameter tab has its own internal vertical scrollbar for the
content on that page. The mouse wheel scrolls the tab contents
wherever the pointer is — you do NOT need to move the cursor over the
scrollbar itself. The wheel scroll behaves like a web page:

    • Pointer over any control, label, or blank space in the tab
      → wheel scrolls the tab's content.
    • Pointer inside a combobox/dropdown or a control that captures
      the wheel for its own purposes (e.g., a scrollable listbox)
      → the wheel's first natural use wins; the tab does not scroll.
    • Pointer over a different tab's content (when tab is switched)
      → wheel scrolls THAT tab.

Works on macOS trackpad two-finger swipe, Windows/Linux wheel-delta,
and Linux legacy Button-4/Button-5 scroll events alike.

NESTED SCROLLABLES

When multiple scrollable regions are visible at once (e.g. a tab with
a scrollable canvas that contains a Signal Generator's own scrollable
sub-panel), the event routes to whichever scrollable actually contains
the pointer at the moment — the innermost match wins.

HOVER TOOLTIPS

Most numeric entry fields across General / Speed / Frequency / Volume /
Pulse / Motion Axis / Trochoid / Trochoid Spatial / Traveling Wave
show a detailed explanation on hover. Leave the pointer over a field
for a moment and a yellow popup appears with what the setting does,
the practical range, and in many cases a recipe or "when to use it"
hint. The tooltip disappears when the pointer leaves the field. On
macOS the popup is placed to the right of the field to avoid the
bug where mouse-down inside the popup dismisses it; if the right
edge would push it off-screen, it flips to the left automatically.

Tooltips are lazily created on hover and torn down on leave — there
is no idle cost when nothing is hovered.

21. TIPS & SUGGESTIONS
================================================================================

GETTING STARTED:
  1. Load a funscript. Run the Signal Analyzer first to get a baseline.
  2. Apply the analyzer's recommendations as a starting point.
  3. Process the file. Test in restim. Adjust one thing at a time.
  4. Use the Animation Viewer to see the spatial pattern and electrode
     intensities before committing to a full processing run.
  5. Save your curve setups to the library (Edit Curve -> Save to Library)
     so you can reuse them across files.

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW FOR A NEW FILE:
  1. Load the funscript.
  2. Open Signal Analyzer -> review the classification and charts.
  3. Click "Apply All Recommendations" for a tuned starting point.
  4. Open Animation Viewer -> play through to check the pattern.
  5. Process and test in restim.
  6. Tune by ear: adjust one parameter, reprocess, test, repeat.

SPEED METHOD SELECTION:
  - Start with Rolling Average (it's what you're used to).
  - Try EMA if the output feels "boxy" or has sudden jumps.
  - Try Savitzky-Golay if peaks feel flattened or rounded off.
  - Use "Compare all methods" in the Speed preview to see differences.
  - The Signal Analyzer will recommend a method based on your file's
    stroke variability — trust it as a starting point.

MODULATION:
  - Enable on E1 and E2 first with defaults (0.5 Hz, depth 0.15).
  - The counter-phased defaults (0 vs 180 deg) give immediate texture.
  - Don't go above depth 0.3 until you know what you're doing.
  - Frequency above 2 Hz starts to feel like vibration, not wobble.
  - Try disabling all response curves (set all to flat 0.5) and enabling
    only modulation — this makes the LFO the sole signal, producing a
    pure slow pulsing sensation shaped entirely by the phase offsets.

PHYSICAL MODEL:
  - Measure your actual electrode spacing. The default 20 mm is a guess.
  - Start with "Natural touch" (300 mm/s) and tune by feel.
  - If the sweep feels too fast/twitchy, lower the speed.
  - Try "follow signal" mode on a script with clear up/down strokes.
  - The physical model is independent of the *-2 phase shift — you can
    use both simultaneously.
  - The Signal Analyzer recommends a propagation speed scaled to your
    file's stroke rate.

TROCHOID SPATIAL TAB:
  - Default OFF. When on, OVERRIDES the response-curve E1-E4 generation —
    your per-axis curves in the Motion Axis (4P) tab are bypassed for
    the .e1-.e4 outputs, replaced by the spatial-mapping calculation.
  - Start with the "Rotating spotlight" recipe (rose, k=5, directional,
    sharpness=2). It's the most directly perceptible pattern and easy
    to verify the override is doing what you want.
  - The top-right preview panel (Intensity vs input) is the fastest way
    to tune. Changing sharpness/cycles/family updates it instantly.
    If all four lines look identical, the mapping is too soft — increase
    sharpness. If only one line ever rises, it's too sharp — lower it.
  - Distance mode rewards curves that physically reach toward electrodes
    (rose petals, hypotrochoid lobes). Directional mode rewards curves
    that orbit (most trochoids). Amplitude mode is a hybrid that adds
    natural emphasis at the curve's outer extremes.
  - Cycles per stroke = 1 means one curve trace per stroke. For a busy
    "buzzing rotation" feel, push to 5-10. For a slow drift across
    electrodes, try 0.25-0.5.
  - Open the Animation Viewer with "Spatial" checked to see the
    trajectory dot follow the curve and the bars fire in sequence —
    excellent for previewing the spatial choreography before processing.
  - Trochoid Spatial does NOT touch alpha/beta or other channels. Only
    the four .e1-.e4 files come from the spatial mapping.

CURVE QUANTIZATION (TROCHOID TAB):
  - Default OFF. Only enable when you actually want quantized output —
    every downstream file (alpha/beta, E1-E4, frequency, volume, pulse)
    inherits the snap.
  - Start with N = 23, family = hypo, projection = radius. That's the
    "tutorial preset" — a clearly visible quantization that doesn't
    destroy the source character.
  - Big differences come from family + projection. Try the same N=23
    on hypo/radius vs rose (k=5)/radius vs butterfly/radius — the level
    distributions are wildly different.
  - Use the Step render mode to verify the snap is doing what you expect,
    then switch back to Interpolated to see the actual playback shape.
  - Turn on Deduplicate Holds on long files — it's harmless (the device
    behaves identically) and keeps file sizes small.
  - The custom expression mode is sandboxed but powerful. Reach for it
    when you want a specific N-tooth saw, pseudo-random levels via
    sin(prime*t) combinations, or non-symmetric distributions.
  - The Animation Viewer reflects the quantization too — open it after
    enabling to see the dimmer strip turn into discrete bands.

RESPONSE CURVES:
  - Linear is boring but predictable. Start there for each axis.
  - Ease-In makes the axis respond more at high positions.
  - Sharp Peak makes the axis spike in the middle of the stroke.
  - The curve editor lets you draw arbitrary shapes with control points.
  - Use Bulk Entry to paste exact coordinates from a spreadsheet.
  - Save curves you like to the library — they persist across sessions.
  - Built-in presets can't be overwritten. If you modify a built-in
    curve and save, it auto-renames to "Custom (<name>)".
  - Use the Waveform Preview to see how curves transform the signal.
  - Use the Animation Viewer's dimmer strip to see the combined effect
    of all four curves over time.

ANIMATION VIEWER TIPS:
  - For fastest playback, disable panels you don't need (uncheck in Show).
  - Dimmer-only mode runs at ~100 FPS.
  - Use Follow mode with a 5-10 second window for a "scrolling scope" view.
  - The waterfall view is best for comparing individual electrode shapes.
  - The heatmap is best for seeing the overall spatial pattern at a glance.
  - Zoom to 800-3200% to inspect individual strokes in the dimmer strip.

SIGNAL ANALYZER TIPS:
  - Always run the analyzer before manually tuning settings — it gives
    you a rational starting point based on the actual signal.
  - The analyzer's recommendations are conservative. Feel free to push
    values further once you understand what each setting does.
  - "Apply Selected" lets you cherry-pick recommendations — click the
    rows you want, then apply only those.
  - After applying, reprocess and test. The analyzer doesn't know your
    subjective preferences — it optimizes for the signal's statistics.
  - Toggle "Apply trochoid quantization to source" to see how
    quantization changes the statistics — useful for understanding
    whether your chosen N is preserving the signal's character or
    flattening too much.

SHAFT VIEWER:
  - Fastest way to see what trochoid-spatial is doing to your file:
    open the Shaft Viewer with 'auto' intensity mode after enabling
    Trochoid Spatial in its tab — the intensity bars on the shaft
    will pulse with the spatial pattern.
  - Put a matching video next to the funscript (same base name,
    .mp4 / .mov / etc.) and the viewer loads it automatically. No
    need to drag-drop every time.
  - Video out of sync on first load? Scrub to a distinctive stroke
    peak, nudge Offset until visibly aligned, then click Sync here —
    the offset becomes permanent for this session.
  - Use the intensity mode dropdown to A/B compare 'spatial' vs
    'curves' vs 'wave' in real-time without touching the main tabs.
    The electrode bars make the difference obvious.
  - Uncheck "Show video" to hide the video panel when you only care
    about the shaft — the shaft canvas grows to fill the freed space
    and the video decoder is skipped, saving a bit of CPU. Video
    state is preserved; toggling back on resumes exactly where it was.
  - Proximity mode is the geometric control — use it to sanity-check
    "what would a simple proximity model do for these electrode
    positions?" before turning on the full processing stack.
  - The horizontal 'Proximity reach' slider sweeps between sharp
    (each electrode fires only in its narrow zone) and broad (all
    electrodes fire simultaneously). Only relevant in proximity mode
    and the fallback path.

TRAVELING WAVE TAB:
  - Default OFF. When on, TAKES PRIORITY over Trochoid Spatial and
    the Motion Axis response curves for E1-E4. Disable it if you
    want the other paths to run.
  - Not sure if it's actually doing anything? Set envelope=constant,
    speed=3 Hz, width=0.08, sharpness=2, noise_gate=0.2 — each
    electrode now fires as a distinct pulse three times per second,
    impossible to miss. Then tune back toward something musical.
  - signal_position is the tightest funscript sync — the crest's
    axial position = y(t) exactly. Wave_speed_hz and speed_mod are
    ignored. Great baseline for "I want electrodes to follow the
    signal, no extra motion".
  - Combine signal_position + exclusive + narrow width (0.10) to
    get a clean 1-of-4 spotlight that hops as the signal crosses
    electrode positions.
  - Noise gate 0.10 (default) is a gentle fuzz-killer. Push to 0.25
    for crisp edges; 0.40+ for "only direct hits fire" feel.
  - The per-axis modulation block from Motion Axis (4P) applies here
    too — enable 8 Hz on E2, 16 Hz on E4, etc. Good way to layer
    per-electrode texture on top of the wave without adding a new
    processor.
  - Saved .e1-.e4 outputs are resampled to 60 Hz internally so the
    wave's motion is actually captured. Without this, a sparse
    funscript can alias the wave away completely. If you're scripting
    against the API and want raw input-grid output, pass
    densify_hz=0 to generate_wave_funscripts.

TROCHOID VIEWER:
  - Launched from the "Trochoid Viewer" button in the main window's
    bottom button row. Pairs the 2D trochoid curve with its shadow
    on the shaft.
  - Shaft mode "shadow" shows continuous projection; "lobes" shows
    the discrete lobe bar-chart with active-lobe highlight. Toggle
    the mode combobox to see both interpretations on the same data.
  - Projection matters a lot for lobes mode. Rose k=5 on projection=
    'radius' detects 9-10 lobes (mathematically correct for |r|);
    on projection='y' detects the visual 5 petals. Pick the one that
    matches what you want to drive electrodes with.
  - Curve parameters (R, r, d, a, k, ...) read from config at open
    time. To reshape the curve, edit the Trochoid Spatial tab and
    reopen the viewer.
  - The viewer's electrode intensity is a SIMPLIFIED proximity model
    for display only — NOT what the processor writes to .e1-.e4
    files. For the true processor output, enable Trochoid Spatial
    (section 14) or Traveling Wave (section 15) and process.

COMPARISON VIEWER (COMPARE FUNSCRIPTS):
  - The fastest sanity check after processing: open the viewer (button
    is in the bottom row) — slot A is pre-loaded with your input file.
    Browse to load the .e1 (or .alpha) output as B. Drag the scrubber
    through the file to spot mismatches.
  - Enable "Difference (B-A)" to get RMS and peak drift numbers —
    great for quantifying "how much did processing change this signal".
  - Enable "Overlay" to spot timing alignment issues — the two signals
    rendered on the same axes make small offsets immediately visible.
  - Use the standalone form (python funscript_compare.py file_a file_b)
    when you don't need the rest of the app — it's the same viewer
    without the main window's overhead.
  - Scroll-wheel zoom is anchored on the cursor — point at the moment
    you want to inspect, then scroll up. Much faster than the Fit
    button + manual scrubber.

PERFORMANCE:
  - EMA is O(n) vs Rolling Average's O(n^2). On long scripts (>60s),
    EMA is noticeably faster.
  - Savitzky-Golay is O(n) per pass but does two passes (derivative +
    smoothing), so it's comparable to EMA in practice.
  - Interpolation Interval of 0.02 (50 pts/sec) is the sweet spot.
    Going to 0.01 doubles processing time for marginal benefit.
  - In the Animation Viewer, disabling the Trajectory panel saves the
    most rendering time (especially in 3D mode).

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
  Animation Viewer:
    Enter (in time field):  Jump to typed time.
    Scrubber drag:          Jump to any point.
  Curve Editor:
    Enter (in X/Y fields):  Add or update point (smart — updates if
                            a point is selected, adds if not).
    Escape:                 Cancel and close.
    Enter (in dialog):      Save and close.

22. SPATIAL 3D LINEAR — XYZ TRIPLET → E1..EN
================================================================================

Takes THREE funscripts — X, Y, Z — and projects a single 3D signal
onto a straight line of electrodes along the shaft axis. Enable with
the "Spatial 3D Linear" checkbox in the bottom button row; the batch
drop zone then reinterprets the first three dropped scripts as X, Y,
Z of one signal.

GEOMETRY:
  X is position along the shaft. Y and Z are the off-axis (transverse)
  dimensions. Electrodes sit at (electrode_x[i], cy, cz), where
  center_yz = (cy, cz) is the shaft line (default (0.5, 0.5)). Raw
  per-electrode intensity = (1 − d/√3)^sharpness, with d = Euclidean
  distance from the signal point to that electrode and √3 = unit-cube
  diagonal (so intensity always lies in [0, 1]).

TUNING PANEL (in Spatial 3D Linear mode):

  The panel is grouped into labeled sections matching the pipeline:
  Projection → Input shaping → Output shaping → Envelope & dynamics →
  Pulse defaults → Reverb. Row numbers below correspond to historic
  ordering; the visual grouping is explicit.

  Row 1 — Electrode math (Projection section)
    Sharpness       Exponent on (1 − d/√3). 1.0 = smooth overlap,
                    4+ = one electrode at a time.
    Electrodes      Count of electrodes in the line (2–4).
    Normalize       Cross-electrode balancing applied after the raw
                    proximity calc.
                    "clamped"   = raw per-electrode intensity clipped
                                  to [0, 1]. Total energy can swing
                                  as some electrodes fall silent.
                    "per_frame" = rebalance so Σ e_i(t) = 1 at every
                                  sample. Preserves relative shape,
                                  kills temporal energy swings, but
                                  forces a [0, 1/N] per-electrode
                                  ceiling.
                    "energy_preserve" = rescale all channels by a
                                        time-varying factor so total
                                        energy stays flat across the
                                        signal without the sum-to-1
                                        ceiling. Pair with the soft-
                                        knee limiter to avoid peak
                                        clipping.

  Row 1b — Per-axis distance weights
    Y weight, Z weight
                    Multipliers applied to dy / dz inside the
                    distance calc: d = sqrt(dx² + (wy·dy)² +
                    (wz·dz)²). 1.0 each (default) = rotation-
                    symmetric Y/Z (the historic kernel where a
                    Y-only motion and a Z-only motion of equal size
                    look identical to every electrode). Set
                    differently to break that symmetry when your
                    tracker's Y and Z axes mean different physical
                    things (e.g. Y = forward/back, Z = lift/drop).
                    0 on an axis removes it entirely — kernel
                    becomes 2D (one axis zeroed) or 1D (both
                    zeroed). Normalization auto-rescales against
                    effective_diag = sqrt(1 + wy² + wz²) so intensity
                    still reaches 0 at the worst-case corner.

  Row 1c — Per-electrode X positions
    Electrode pos   Per-electrode X positions along the shaft axis
    (E1-E4)         (0 = base, 1 = tip). Defaults to the four-slot
                    linspace(0.1, 0.9, 4) = [0.1, 0.37, 0.63, 0.9].
                    Match these to your physical device's electrode
                    spacing when it isn't evenly distributed. Four
                    slots are stored even when n_electrodes = 3 so
                    the UI stays populated; the processor reads only
                    the first n entries. Positions need not be
                    sorted — out-of-order layouts work (useful for
                    non-standard rigs). Values are clipped to [0, 1]
                    at write time.

  Row 1d — Distance falloff shape
    Falloff         Which distance-to-intensity curve the kernel
                    uses. Sharpness above still applies as a post-
                    exponent so it keeps its meaning across shapes.
                    "linear"         = 1 − d/(w·diag), clamped.
                                       Hard-edge at w·diag; legacy
                                       default.
                    "gaussian"       = bell curve, smooth and
                                       asymptotic (no hard zero).
                                       Softest blend between
                                       adjacent electrodes.
                    "raised_cosine"  = flat peak + zero-slope cutoff.
                                       Good when each electrode
                                       should feel "plateaued" near
                                       its position.
                    "inverse_square" = physical falloff (light /
                                       gravity). 0.5 at d=scale,
                                       slow tail.
    Width           Scale on the effective cube diagonal that sets
                    each shape's characteristic knee / sigma / radius.
                    1.0 (default) = full diagonal — for linear this
                    matches the historic 1-d/√3 formula. Lower
                    tightens the falloff; higher broadens.

  Row 1e — Per-electrode sharpness override
    Per-E sharp     Enable per-channel sharpness in place of the
                    single Sharpness slider. When ON, each electrode
                    takes its exponent from its own entry field
                    (E1-E4 below). When OFF (default), the single
                    Sharpness applies to every electrode — byte-
                    identical to the legacy behavior. Values below
                    0.01 are floored to avoid zero/negative
                    exponents. Use to accentuate a primary electrode
                    (center-heavy, outward-flare, etc.) without
                    touching the rest.

  Row 2 — Envelope shaping
    Speed norm pct  Percentile used to normalize the magnitude |v| of
                    the 3D velocity vector before clipping to [0, 1].
                    The pipeline divides every sample of |v| by the
                    N-th percentile of the |v| distribution — 0.99
                    (default) means "1% of samples are allowed to
                    saturate above 1.0 before clipping kicks in," so
                    a single fast artifact spike doesn't flatten the
                    rest of the signal. 1.0 = normalize against the
                    true peak (one artifact can dominate). 0.95 =
                    more aggressive (more headroom for normal motion
                    at the cost of losing the tallest 5% of peaks).
                    Rule of thumb: leave at 0.99 unless your capture
                    has obvious spike artifacts.

    Freq×|v| mix    Blend the flat default frequency with per-frame
                    |v|. 0.0 = flat (prior behavior), 1.0 = fully
                    |v|-driven. Faster motion → higher carrier Hz.

    Ramp % (total)  Total percent rise across the clip's duration.
                    40 means the clip opens at 60% and climbs
                    linearly to 100% by the penultimate sample, then
                    fades to 0 on the very last sample. 0 disables
                    the ramp. Length-independent — 30 seconds at 40%
                    behaves the same as 30 minutes at 40%. This is
                    S3D-specific; the 1D pipeline still uses its own
                    %/hour rate over in the Volume tab.

  Row 3 — Parameter defaults (0.0–1.0 normalized — restim does the
  actual Hz / μs conversion)
    Freq default    Carrier frequency baseline.
    Pulse freq      Pulse rate baseline.
    Pulse width     Pulse duration baseline.
    Pulse rise      Pulse attack shape baseline.

  Row 4 — Electrode smoothing (Butterworth low-pass on E1..En)
    Smooth E1..En   Toggle (off by default).
    Cutoff Hz       1–24 Hz. 8 Hz is a reasonable start if you hear
                    flicker.
    Order           1–6. Default 2.

  Row 5 — Dedup-holds on E1..En
    Dedup holds     Drop interior samples of constant-within-tolerance
                    runs on each electrode. Shrinks output files and
                    prevents the device's linear interpolation from
                    sloping across held windows.
    Tolerance       Absolute tolerance for "constant" (0.005 = 0.5%
                    of full scale).

  Rows — Output shaping toolkit (Output shaping section, in-kernel)
    Four post-projection stages that run INSIDE the kernel, between
    Normalize and the processor-level Row 4 Butterworth smoothing /
    compression / dedup. All off by default — turn one on at a time
    to learn each effect in isolation.

    Pipeline order inside the kernel:
      raw proximity → Normalize → Smooth output (1€) → Velocity weight
        → Electrode gain → Soft-knee limiter → final clip

    Smooth output (1€)  Velocity-adaptive One-Euro low-pass applied
                        per electrode. Different from the Row 4
                        Butterworth below — One-Euro tracks motion:
                        heavy smoothing at rest (min_cutoff Hz), then
                        cutoff rises with velocity so fast strokes
                        don't lag-ring. Kills coil-ramp-rate
                        discontinuities at high sharpness × busy
                        tracker input without dulling motion.
                          Min Hz — baseline cutoff at zero velocity.
                                    Lower = heavier rest smoothing.
                          Beta   — velocity-to-cutoff gain. Higher =
                                    more transparent on fast changes.
                        Typical: 1.0 Hz, beta 0.05.

    Velocity-weight     Multiply every electrode by a per-frame
                        [0, 1] gate derived from |d(X, Y, Z)/dt|
                        magnitude. Held positions → quiet; fast
                        motion → full intensity. Feels more like
                        "touch-while-moving" than steady-state
                        proximity output. Scalar — all electrodes
                        get the same weight.
                          Floor           — weight when motionless
                                             (0 = silent on holds,
                                             0.3 = 30% baseline).
                          Response        — exponent on normalized
                                             speed (1 = linear,
                                             >1 sharpens the gate,
                                             <1 softens it).
                          Smooth Hz       — low-pass on raw velocity
                                             so single spikes don't
                                             dominate (default 3 Hz).
                          Peak percentile — quantile taken as "full
                                             motion" (0.99 ignores
                                             isolated spikes).

    Electrode gain      Per-channel multiplicative trim applied
    (E1 / E2 / E3 / E4)  after velocity weight, before the limiter.
                        0.0 mutes, 1.0 unity, 2.0 doubles. Values
                        above 1 would hard-clip at the final clamp —
                        pair with Soft-knee limiter to avoid
                        crunchy peaks. Use case: physical-device
                        channel balancing when one coil runs hotter
                        or colder than the others.

    Soft-knee limiter   Tanh-based smooth limiter applied last,
                        before the final [0, 1] clip. Peaks above
                        Threshold curve asymptotically toward 1.0
                        instead of hard-clipping. Pair naturally
                        with Electrode gain > 1 or Normalize =
                        energy_preserve to tame overshoots.
                          Threshold — knee position in (0.1, 0.99).
                                       0.85 default. Lower = more
                                       compression (earlier knee);
                                       higher = more transparent
                                       (later knee).

    Solo / Mute (S/M)   DAW-style listening filter applied at the
                        very end of the pipeline — after every
                        shaping stage and the limiter, just before
                        the final clip. Per-electrode S and M
                        checkboxes:
                          Mute — force that channel to silence.
                          Solo — when any channel is soloed, only
                                 soloed channels play. Mute wins
                                 over solo on the same channel.
                        Both persist in config, so processor runs
                        respect them. Use the "Clear" button to
                        reset all 8 toggles before saving a
                        variant meant for shipping, or the output
                        funscripts will inherit the muted channels.

  Row 6 — Geometric mapping (drives pulse channels from 3D geometry)
    All default 0.0 (flat). Enable one at a time on device to hear
    the effect — a little geometric flavor goes a long way.

    MENTAL MODEL: imagine the shaft as a line down the middle of a
    unit cube. X is position along the shaft (stroke). Y and Z are
    the off-axis dimensions — where the tracker "wobbles" relative
    to center. Each geometric mixer feeds one pulse channel from a
    different aspect of that motion:
      * How far off-center am I?     → radial (distance)
      * Which direction off-center?  → azimuth (angle around shaft)
      * Am I moving toward center?   → dr/dt (radial velocity)
      * Am I spinning around shaft?  → dω/dt (4-DoF roll only)

    Visualize: the signal traces a path inside a sphere. Radial is
    the sphere's radius at each point. Azimuth is the compass angle
    around the shaft. dr/dt is whether the radius is expanding or
    contracting right now. dω/dt is how fast the roll angle is
    spinning (requires a .rz / .roll / .twist file in the drop).

      PW × radial     pulse_width driven by radial distance from the
                      shaft axis. Further off-axis = fuller pulse.
                      Hold the device at center → thin pulse. Wobble
                      outward → fat pulse. Set to 0.3 for noticeable
                      width modulation without losing pulse clarity.

      PR × azimuth    pulse_rise_time driven by azimuth via
                      (cos(phi)+1)/2 — smooth and wrap-free but
                      sign-collapsing (rise-time is symmetric, so
                      folding +phi and −phi onto the same rise value
                      is fine). Creates a rotational "texture" as the
                      signal orbits around the shaft.

      PF × dr/dt      pulse_frequency driven by radial VELOCITY —
                      percentile-normalized and centered at 0.5.
                      Moving outward pushes it above 0.5; moving
                      inward pulls it below. Push-in and pull-out
                      feel distinct. Percentile-normalized so a
                      single spike doesn't saturate the curve.

      PF × dω/dt      pulse_frequency driven by ROLL angular
                      velocity (requires a .rz / .roll / .twist
                      file in the drop). Sums into the same pulse_
                      frequency as PF × dr/dt — both contributions
                      add, then clip to [0, 1]. Clockwise rotation
                      pushes above 0.5, counter-clockwise below.
                      Without a roll file, this slider has no
                      effect.

  Row 7 — Temporal dynamics (τ knobs + floor)
    All default 0.0 (off). Reshape how motion-derived signals evolve
    in time and how low they're allowed to drop.
      Release τ (s)   Asymmetric leaky integrator on speed_y. Instant
                      attack, exponential decay when motion slows —
                      intensity hangs briefly after a pause instead of
                      snapping dead. 0.3 ≈ 37% remaining 300 ms after
                      motion stops. Audible only when Freq×|v| mix > 0.
      Hold τ (s)      Symmetric EMA smoothing on the three geometric
                      source signals (radial, azimuth, dr/dt) before
                      they blend into the pulse channels. Kills chatter
                      from small wobbles. 0.1 ≈ 100 ms settling. Audible
                      only when at least one PW/PR/PF mix > 0.
      Speed floor     Minimum value for speed_y AFTER the release
                      envelope. Rest-level style floor on the motion-
                      derived carrier so the device doesn't go silent
                      during pauses. 0.0 = off (signal can decay to 0);
                      0.3 = always at least 30% intensity. Audible only
                      when Freq×|v| mix > 0.

  Row 8 — Reverb
    Master enable + four wet/dry mixes, all defaulting to 0.0 (off)
    so the baseline output is unchanged until you opt in. Four
    envelope-rate analogs of audio reverb — delayed + attenuated
    copies of a signal summed back into itself. Reverb can't create
    energy that isn't there: if a channel is a flat 2-point
    funscript (e.g. pulse_width with its radial mix = 0) the
    corresponding tail is silent. Tune the baseline signal first,
    then layer these on top. Runs after electrode smoothing, before
    dedup (dedup collapses reverb tails — disable Dedup while
    tuning reverb mixes, then re-enable).

    Advanced delay and feedback timings (per-tap delays, feedback
    coefficients, tap gains) live in the `spatial_3d_linear.reverb`
    block of config.json. The sliders in the panel are the wet/dry
    mixes you A/B on device; the timings stay as sensible defaults
    unless you specifically want to retune them.

      Reverb          Master enable toggle.
      Vol tail        Single-tap IIR feedback delay on volume_y.
                      Discrete echoes of intensity; at 200 ms × 0.4
                      feedback (default) you hear each stroke's envelope
                      echo back. Feedback > 0.5 self-sustains. Bounded
                      at 0.95 for stability.
      Vol multi       FIR sum of 4 incommensurate delays (83/127/191/
                      307 ms by default, Schroeder-style). Dense,
                      spacious tail with no single echo audible. Most
                      traditionally reverb-like.
      Cross-E         Cross-electrode bleed: each E gets delayed copies
                      of its neighbors' envelopes summed in. Creates
                      sensation movement through the array even when
                      source position is stationary. No audio
                      equivalent — reverb-in-geometry rather than
                      reverb-in-time.
      PW tail         Feedback delay on the blended pulse_width signal.
                      Only audible when PW × radial mix > 0 (otherwise
                      pulse_width is a flat 2-point funscript and there's
                      nothing to echo).

RAMP-IN / FADE-OUT:
  Volume is multiplied by a linear ramp that rises across the whole
  clip from (100 − Ramp%) to 100, then fades to 0 on the very last
  sample. At 40% on a 73-second capture, volume opens at 60 × motion
  and climbs smoothly to 100 × motion over the minute-plus duration.
  Length-independent — the slider means the same thing on any clip
  length. Set to 0 to disable the ramp entirely. This is distinct
  from the 1D pipeline's volume.ramp_percent_per_hour (which is
  rate-based and barely moves on short previews).

OUTPUT:
  Same filenames as the 1D pipeline: .e1..eN, .volume, .speed,
  .frequency, .pulse_frequency, .pulse_width, .pulse_rise_time.

WORKFLOW:
  1. Enable "Spatial 3D (X,Y,Z triplet)" (bottom button row). The
     main Parameters tab-bar hides because none of those tabs feed
     the 3D pipeline — only Ramp %/hr is shared, and it's mirrored
     into the S3D panel.
  2. Drop three funscripts (four for 4-DoF with roll). The triplet
     orderer recognizes both naming conventions:

       canonical funscript — X slot: .x  or .sway
                             Y slot: .y, .heave, .stroke, or plain
                             Z slot: .z  or .surge
                             rz   :  .rz, .roll, or .twist

     Plain `<name>.funscript` is treated as stroke (Y) — matches
     fungen's capture convention where the primary stroke channel
     has no suffix. Files with non-triplet markers (.pitch, .yaw,
     .vib, .valve, .suck) are silently dropped so they can't
     contaminate a slot. Unknown suffixes still fall through to
     alphabetical fill — if your tool invents a new one, tell us
     and we'll add it to the recognized / drop list.

     The input entry shows "X: fileA / Y: fileB / Z: fileC / rz:
     fileD" after ordering so you can confirm before processing.
  3. Click "Process All Files". Outputs land next to the X file.
  4. Inspect in the Animation Viewer (3D mode), the Shaft Viewer,
     or the T-code Preview (Browse… → output folder).

TOOLTIPS & VARIANTS:
  - Every control in the tuning panel has a hover tooltip with a
    one-paragraph explanation of what it does and typical values.
    Hover the label, the slider, or the readout.
  - A/B/C/D variants carry all your S3D tuning (mixes, smoothing,
    dedup, param defaults, geometric mappings, τ knobs, Ramp %).
    The S3D enabled checkbox is GLOBAL — switching variants leaves
    it where you set it. When triplet mode is active, the variant
    worker runs one process_triplet per slot (not per-file), so
    each variant folder gets a proper 3D output set.

OUTPUT FILENAMES:
  Spatial 3D processing strips the input's axis marker before
  naming outputs. Dropping `test video.sway.funscript` (+ surge +
  roll + plain) produces `test video.alpha/beta/e1-e4/...funscript`
  in a `test video_variants/<slot>/` folder — matching the video
  filename so the T-code preview finds the video automatically.

23. TUNING WALKTHROUGH — SPATIAL 3D LINEAR (ON-DEVICE CHECKLIST)
================================================================================

A practical order to turn knobs when you're at the hardware. One
variable at a time; save snapshots to A/B/C/D between passes so you
can flip back if a change made it worse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
0. BASELINE SANITY CHECK — save as VARIANT A (never overwrite)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  [ ] Spatial 3D Linear ☑
  [ ] Sharpness = 1.0, Electrodes = 4, Normalize = clamped
  [ ] Speed norm pct = 0.99
  [ ] All mixes at 0 (Freq×|v|, PW/PR/PF × radial/azimuth/dr/dt/dω/dt)
  [ ] All τ at 0, Speed floor = 0
  [ ] Smooth + Dedup off
  [ ] Freq default / Pulse freq / Pulse width / Pulse rise all 0.5
  [ ] Ramp % (total) = 40

  Listen for: does anything happen at all? Is volume tracking your
  movement? If not, the triplet ordering is probably wrong — check
  the "X: / Y: / Z:" line matches what you intend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DOES THE BASELINE SOUND ALIVE?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  The 0.5 flat defaults usually feel weak. Test two knobs:

  [ ] Pulse freq → 0.75 (off the 1D floor). Biggest single-knob
      improvement if pulse is weak.
  [ ] Sharpness → try 2.0 vs 4.0. Hear the difference between
      "blended electrodes" and "switched electrodes." Pick what
      matches your rig.

  Save to VARIANT B once you have a decent baseline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. MOTION COUPLING — does it breathe with the stroke?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  [ ] Freq×|v| mix → 0.3. Faster motion should raise the carrier.
      Subtle.
  [ ] Try 0.5 to make it obvious. Test with a deliberate
      fast-then-slow gesture — you should feel the surge.
  [ ] Release τ → 0.3. Stop moving mid-stroke. Intensity should
      hang briefly instead of snapping dead. Bump to 0.8 for a
      long tail; that usually feels too much.
  [ ] Speed floor → 0.2. Carrier now holds at 20% intensity during
      long pauses instead of decaying to silence. Pair with Release
      τ — the release gives a natural decay curve, the floor stops
      it at a non-zero minimum. Raise to 0.4 for a "never quiet"
      feel; drop to 0 to let pauses go fully silent.

  Save to VARIANT C.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. GEOMETRIC CHARACTER — does wobble/rotation do anything?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Needs actual off-axis motion in your source to be audible.
  Mental model: picture the tracker tracing a path inside a sphere
  around the shaft. Each knob below listens to a different aspect
  of that path (distance, angle, or rate of change). Test ONE at
  a time so you learn each feel in isolation.

  [ ] PW × radial → 0.4. Listens to distance from center.
      Wobble off-axis → fuller pulse. Deliberate "trace a circle"
      gesture makes it obvious.

  [ ] PF × dr/dt → 0.4. Listens to rate of that distance changing.
      Push-in vs pull-out should feel distinct now — sign-preserving
      (outward > 0.5, inward < 0.5).

  [ ] PR × azimuth → 0.3. Listens to angle around the shaft.
      Rotation at constant depth → pulse shape texture shifts.
      Subtlest of the three because azimuth folds at ±π (but
      rise-time is symmetric anyway).

  [ ] PF × dω/dt → 0.4 (requires a .rz / .roll / .twist file in
      the drop — 4-DoF mode). Listens to roll angular velocity.
      Sums with PF × dr/dt into the same pulse_frequency channel,
      so both contributions blend. Without a roll file, this knob
      is a no-op; if you see no effect, your drop is 3-axis only.

  [ ] Hold τ → 0.1-0.2 once any geometric mix is on. This EMA-
      smooths radial/azimuth/dr/dt/dω/dt BEFORE they drive the
      pulse channels, so fast jitter doesn't chatter the pulse
      settings. 0.1 ≈ 100 ms settling. Raise to 0.3 if you feel
      high-frequency tingling on fast gestures; drop back to 0
      if the pulse feels mushy / late.

  Save to VARIANT D (or overwrite whichever you like least).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. ELECTRODE CLEANUP (only if you hear problems)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  [ ] Smooth E1..En ☑, Cutoff 8 Hz. Turn on if you hear flicker
      or tingle-noise. If output feels dulled, raise cutoff to
      12+ Hz.
  [ ] Dedup holds ☑, Tolerance 0.005. Shrinks files and prevents
      the device interpolating across held values. Usually
      imperceptible in feel, noticeable in file size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4a. IN-KERNEL PROJECTION GEOMETRY (optional tweaks)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  A second round of projection-stage knobs that sit next to Sharpness
  in the Projection group. Most rigs feel fine at defaults — touch
  these when a specific physical or tracker mismatch needs fixing.

  [ ] Y weight / Z weight — 1.0 each is the rotation-symmetric
      default. If your tracker's Y and Z axes carry different
      physical meanings (Y = forward/back, Z = lift/drop), try
      wy=1.5 and wz=0.8 to emphasise Y without touching X. wy=0
      or wz=0 removes that axis entirely (useful when a channel
      isn't meaningful). Normalization auto-rescales — intensity
      still reaches 0 at the worst-case corner.

  [ ] Electrode pos (E1..E4) — X positions along the shaft,
      0=base, 1=tip. Defaults match linspace(0.1, 0.9, 4). Match
      your physical device when electrodes aren't evenly spaced:
      e.g. [0.05, 0.15, 0.85, 0.95] for a clustered base+tip rig.
      Positions need not be sorted; any layout is valid.

  [ ] Falloff + Width — "linear" + 1.0 is the legacy hard-edge
      1 − d/√3. Try "gaussian" + 0.6 if electrode transitions feel
      too switchy on high sharpness — the Gaussian softens them
      smoothly. "inverse_square" gives a "physical" slow tail.
      "raised_cosine" flattens the peak near each electrode.

  [ ] Per-E sharp override — enable and set E1-E4 sharpness
      individually to accentuate a primary channel. Example:
      [1.0, 4.0, 4.0, 1.0] gives a center-heavy rig where E2/E3
      are "one-at-a-time" selective while E1/E4 stay soft for
      blend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4b. IN-KERNEL OUTPUT SHAPING (optional — shape-then-cleanup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  The four post-projection shaping stages (Normalize alternatives,
  Smooth output 1€, Velocity-weight, Electrode gain, Soft-knee
  limiter) run INSIDE the kernel before Stage 4 above. Enable one
  at a time — each has a distinct signature that's easy to confuse
  with Stage 4 effects if you flip multiple switches at once.

  [ ] Try Normalize = energy_preserve. Listen for: does the
      overall loudness feel steadier across the clip? If you had
      obvious hot and cold spots earlier, those should even out
      without the per_frame ceiling clamping everything down.

  [ ] Smooth output (1€) ☑, Min Hz 1.0, Beta 0.05. Different from
      Stage 4 Butterworth — this one goes transparent during fast
      motion. Good if your tracker is noisy when you're still but
      clean during strokes. If you've got both on, you can lower
      the Butterworth cutoff since 1€ already handles the rest-
      state jitter.

  [ ] Velocity-weight ☑, Floor 0.0, Response 1.0. Listen for:
      do holds go quiet while strokes stay loud? This should feel
      qualitatively different from steady-state output — the
      "touch-while-moving" feel. If holds are TOO quiet, raise
      Floor to 0.2 - 0.4 so there's always a baseline. If the
      hold-to-motion transition feels mushy, raise Response to
      1.5 - 2.0 to sharpen the gate.

  [ ] Electrode gain (E1-E4). If one coil feels weaker on-device,
      bump its slider from 1.0 to 1.3 or so. If it feels too hot,
      trim to 0.7. Always enable Soft-knee limiter before pushing
      any channel above 1.0 or the peaks hard-clip.

  [ ] Soft-knee limiter ☑, Threshold 0.85. Turn on whenever you
      use gain > 1 or normalize = energy_preserve (which can push
      sums above 1). Lower threshold = more compression; 0.85 is
      a musical default. Listen for: peaks that used to feel
      "crunchy" should now feel smooth and rolled off.

  [ ] Solo / Mute (S/M) — listening-level toggles for tuning.
      Solo an electrode to hear it in isolation; mute to silence
      just that channel. Mute wins over solo on the same channel.
      Persists in config, so the processor respects them on
      "Process All Files" — use the Clear button BEFORE saving
      a variant for shipping, or the output funscripts will
      inherit the muted channels. Common tuning pattern: Solo E2
      while tweaking sharpness / falloff / pos to feel that one
      channel; repeat for E3, E4, E1; Clear when done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. VOLUME ENVELOPE SHAPE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  [ ] Ramp % (total) → total percent rise across the whole clip.
      Default 40 opens at 60% and climbs linearly to 100% by the
      penultimate sample, then fades to 0 on the last sample.
      Length-independent — 40% on a 60-second test clip behaves
      the same way as 40% on a 60-minute session.

      Reasonable knobs:
        20  — gentle (start at 80%)
        40  — default, clearly climbing
        60  — aggressive (start at 40%, big build)
        0   — disables the ramp entirely (flat × motion)

      Distinct from the 1D pipeline's %/hour rate (Volume tab) —
      that one's rate-based and invisible on short clips by design.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. REVERB LAYER (after baseline is tuned)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Reverb thickens an already-interesting signal; it can't rescue a
  dead baseline. Work through steps 1-3 first so you have genuine
  motion and geometric character to echo. Turn on one effect at a
  time to learn what each adds — stacking them at once muddies the
  attribution.

  [ ] Reverb ☑ (master enable).

  [ ] Vol multi → 0.3. The most classical-reverb-feeling one. FIR
      sum of four incommensurate delays (83/127/191/307 ms). Listen
      for a thicker, denser envelope — no single echo, just
      spaciousness. Raise toward 0.5 for "big hall"; drop toward
      0.1 for subtle body.

  [ ] Cross-E → 0.3. The novel one — no audio equivalent. Each
      electrode receives delayed copies of its neighbors' envelopes,
      so sensation travels through the array even when the source
      position is steady. Listen for motion BETWEEN electrodes on
      held strokes. Unique to multi-electrode setups.

  [ ] Vol tail → 0.3. Single-tap IIR feedback delay on volume_y —
      discrete echoes rather than a wash. Feels rhythmic and
      interacts with stroke cadence. Keep the advanced feedback
      config < 0.5 (default 0.4 is safe) or it will self-sustain.

  [ ] PW tail → 0.2 (only if PW × radial is already > 0). Echoes
      the pulse_width signal for a breathing character. Silent if
      PW × radial = 0 because there's no pulse_width modulation
      to echo.

  Testing note: reverb tails are exactly the pattern dedup collapses.
  Disable Dedup while testing reverb or you won't hear the tail.
  Re-enable once you've dialed the mixes.

  If things get chattery, buzzy, or runaway: drop the active wet
  mix, or bump up Hold τ, or disable reverb entirely. Advanced
  params (delay_ms, feedback) are in config.json if you want to
  tune beyond the default echo times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTING GESTURES — repeat each after every variable change
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Steady medium stroke — does it feel consistent or lurching?
  2. Fast burst then stop — does the tail decay well?
     (Release τ, smoothing)
  3. Off-axis wobble at constant depth — does pulse character
     change? (PW × radial, PR × azimuth)
  4. Deliberate push-in vs pull-out — do they feel different?
     (PF × dr/dt)
  5. Very slow stroke — does anything happen at all, or does it
     feel dead? (Pulse freq default, volume envelope)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RED FLAGS → FIRST THING TO TRY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Feels dead everywhere
      Pulse freq → 0.75; Freq default → 0.65; Speed floor → 0.2

  Goes silent between strokes
      Speed floor → 0.2 (only works with Freq×|v| mix > 0)

  Jittery / chattery
      Hold τ → 0.15; Smooth E1..En on; if reverb is on, drop
      active mixes back to 0

  Too static / mechanical
      Freq×|v| mix → 0.4; Release τ → 0.3

  Flicker between electrodes
      Smoothing cutoff → 5 Hz

  Runaway buzz / self-sustain after a change
      Reverb feedback too high or wet mix too aggressive — lower
      the wet mix, or edit config.json to drop reverb.*.feedback
      below 0.5. Bounded at 0.95 max.

  Reverb tails inaudible
      Dedup is collapsing them. Turn off Dedup while testing
      reverb, re-enable once mixes are dialed.

  Doesn't respond to motion at all
      Check XYZ assignment in the input entry; check
      Freq×|v| mix isn't still 0

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A/B/C/D SNAPSHOT DISCIPLINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Save A as pure baseline and don't touch it.
  - Use B/C/D as working copies for each tuning pass.
  - If a change makes things worse, switch back to the prior slot
    and try again. The S3D enable toggle is global, so flipping
    variants won't drop you out of 3D mode mid-tuning.

24. SPATIAL 3D LINEAR — SIGNAL FLOW DIAGRAM (PIPELINE VIEW)
================================================================================

Section 22 lists every knob row-by-row; this section shows where those
knobs plug into the processing pipeline and in what order the stages
run. Use this view when you want to understand WHY a tuning change
affects what it does, not just what the control is named.

The pipeline runs in strict order:

    Input funscripts (X, Y, Z, [rz])  →  resample to 50 Hz
              |
              v

    [STAGE 5]  Parameter channels (emit funscripts)
              |
              v
    Outputs: .e1..eN, .volume, .speed, .frequency, .pulse_frequency,
             .pulse_width, .pulse_rise_time

Each stage below lists exactly which knobs from section 22 act at
that point and how the data flowing in changes shape on the way out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 0 — INPUT PROCESSING (per-axis, before projection)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Runs independently on each of X, Y, Z, and rz after the 50 Hz
  resample but before the 3D point enters the projection. Three
  optional sub-stages, each with a master enable checkbox — all
  default OFF.

    1. Noise gate
         Knobs:  threshold, window (s), attack (s), release (s), rest
         Effect: ONE envelope is computed from the maximum peak-to-peak
                 across X/Y/Z/rz in a rolling window, and ALL four axes
                 collapse toward "rest" simultaneously when the gate
                 closes. Coherent — the 3D trajectory stays
                 geometrically valid during quiet passages.

    2. Smooth input (1-Euro)
         Knobs:  min Hz, beta
         Effect: Velocity-adaptive low-pass per axis. At rest, heavy
                 smoothing (≈ min_cutoff Hz). On fast motion, cutoff
                 rises with velocity so intentional strokes stay
                 transparent. Higher beta = more responsive.

    3. Sharpen input
         Knobs:  pre-emph, saturate
         Effect: Unsharp-mask high-frequency boost, then a soft tanh
                 clip toward 0 / 1 to make values sit near the rails
                 more often. The counterpart to input smoothing —
                 when a smooth tracker (e.g. Mask-Moments) needs its
                 punch restored.

  End of Stage 0: (X, Y, Z, rz) per-axis traces, cleaned and shaped.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 1a — SPATIAL PROJECTION (3D point → N electrodes, raw proximity)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  The core geometry pass. Covered in detail in section 22's
  GEOMETRY box; the pipeline-level view:

    Knobs:   Sharpness (or Per-E sharp override), Electrodes,
             Electrode pos (E1..En X positions along the shaft),
             Y weight, Z weight, Falloff shape, Falloff width

    Inputs:  (x, y, z) per frame, electrode positions from the
             configured Electrode pos row (default linspace
             0.1 → 0.9), center_yz (default 0.5, 0.5), per-axis
             weights wy and wz.

    Distance (per electrode):
               d_i = sqrt((x − Ei.x)² + (wy · (y − cy))² +
                          (wz · (z − cz))²)

    Effective diagonal (auto-rescales with weights so intensity
    still reaches 0 at the worst-case corner):
               effective_diag = sqrt(1 + wy² + wz²)

    Raw intensity (shape-dependent):
               scale = falloff_width · effective_diag
               raw_i = _apply_falloff(d_i, falloff_shape, scale)
               raw_i = raw_i ^ sharpness[i]

    Falloff shape choices are shown in section 22 Row 1d —
    linear (legacy 1 − d/scale), gaussian, raised_cosine,
    inverse_square.

    Per-E sharp override: when enabled, sharpness[i] comes from
    the 4 per-electrode entries rather than the single Sharpness
    slider. Useful for accentuating a primary electrode while
    keeping others softer.

  End of Stage 1a: raw E1..En arrays BEFORE any shaping, plus a
  derived volume envelope:

       volume_y[frame] = max(E1[frame], ..., En[frame])

  volume_y is ALWAYS computed from this CLAMPED-raw version — not
  from the shaped output of Stage 1b. That way the envelope still
  dips when the signal drifts to a cube corner, even if the user
  picks per_frame normalization (which would otherwise hide that
  dip) or heavy shaping downstream.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 1b — OUTPUT-SHAPING TOOLKIT (inside the kernel)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Five post-projection shaping stages, all OFF by default so the
  pre-Phase-2 behavior is preserved byte-identical when nothing is
  enabled. Each runs at a specific position so the combined pipeline
  has predictable semantics.

  Pipeline order — each stage consumes the output of the previous:

    raw E1..En (from Stage 1a)
       │
       ▼
    1. Cross-electrode Normalize
       │   Knob: Normalize
       │   "clamped"         → noop (raw per-electrode).
       │   "per_frame"       → rescale so Σ Ei(t) = 1 at every frame.
       │                        Preserves relative shape, kills
       │                        temporal energy swings, forces a
       │                        [0, 1/N] ceiling per electrode.
       │   "energy_preserve" → rescale by a time-varying factor so
       │                        Σ Ei(t) equals its time-average. No
       │                        sum-to-1 ceiling. Pair with limiter.
       ▼
    2. One-Euro output smoothing (per electrode)
       │   Knobs:  Smooth output, Min Hz, Beta
       │   Adaptive low-pass — heavy smoothing at rest, transparent
       │   on fast motion. Kills coil-ramp-rate discontinuities that
       │   high sharpness × busy tracker input can produce.
       ▼
    3. Velocity-weighted gate (all electrodes, scalar)
       │   Knobs:  Velocity-weight, Floor, Response, Smooth Hz,
       │           Peak percentile
       │   weight(t) = floor + (1 − floor) × normalize(speed(t))^resp
       │   where speed(t) = sqrt(dX² + dY² + dZ²), smoothed and
       │   percentile-normalized. Held positions → quiet, fast
       │   motion → full intensity.
       ▼
    4. Per-electrode gain (E1 / E2 / E3 / E4, constant across time)
       │   Knob:   Electrode gain per channel
       │   Ei(t) ← Ei(t) × gain_i. 0 mutes, 1 unity, 2 doubles.
       │   Applied after velocity weight so per-channel trim shapes
       │   the already-gated signal.
       ▼
    5. Soft-knee limiter
       │   Knobs:  Soft-knee limiter, Threshold
       │   Tanh limiter — samples below Threshold pass through,
       │   samples above curve asymptotically toward 1.0. Prevents
       │   the hard-clip artifacts that Electrode gain > 1 or
       │   energy_preserve overshoots would otherwise produce at the
       │   final clamp.
       ▼
    6. Solo / Mute mask (DAW-style listening filter)
       │   Knobs:  S / M per electrode + Clear button
       │   When any channel is soloed, only soloed channels play.
       │   Muted channels are always silent (mute wins over solo
       │   on the same channel). No-op when no toggle is active —
       │   no allocations, byte-identical to pre-feature output.
       ▼
    7. Final clip + NaN sanitation (safety net, always on)

  End of Stage 1b: shaped E1..En. volume_y from Stage 1a stays
  untouched — the envelope reflects raw proximity, not the shaped
  output, so ramp / compression / frequency derivations downstream
  remain grounded in the un-shaped signal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 2 — VOLUME ENVELOPE + SPEED BRANCH
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Two parallel tracks derived from the Stage 1 outputs.

  TRACK A — volume_y (the intensity envelope)
  --------------------------------------------

    1. Reverb on volume_y (if master enable is on)
         Knobs:  Vol tail mix, Vol multi mix
         Effect: IIR single-tap (tail) and FIR multi-tap (multi)
                 layered onto volume_y.

    2. Ramp across clip
         Knob:   Ramp %
         Effect: Linear rise from (100 − Ramp%) at t=0 to 100% at
                 t_end, applied by multiplication into volume_y.
                 Length-independent.

  TRACK B — speed_y (feeds the carrier frequency channel)
  -------------------------------------------------------

    1. 3D velocity magnitude
         |v| = sqrt(dx/dt² + dy/dt² + dz/dt²)

    2. Percentile normalization
         Knob:   Speed norm pct
         Effect: speed_y = clamp(|v| / quantile(|v|, p), 0, 1)
                 0.99 ignores single-sample spikes; 1.0 uses true
                 peak and is spike-sensitive.

    3. Release envelope on speed_y
         Knob:   Release τ (s)
         Effect: Asymmetric leaky integrator — instant attack,
                 exponential decay. Audible only when Freq × |v|
                 mix > 0 downstream.

    4. Speed floor
         Knob:   Speed floor
         Effect: Rest-level minimum applied AFTER the release
                 envelope. Prevents dead silence in pauses.

  End of Stage 2: shaped volume_y, shaped speed_y. The per-electrode
  E1..En arrays are untouched here; they continue straight into
  Stage 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 3 — GEOMETRIC MAPPING (drivers for pulse parameter channels)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  From the source (Y, Z, rz) signals, derive four geometric scalars
  used only if the corresponding pulse mix knob is > 0.

    Radial distance:    r       = sqrt((y − cy)² + (z − cz)²)
    Azimuth:            φ       = atan2(z − cz, y − cy)
    Radial velocity:    dr/dt
    Roll velocity:      dω/dt   (from rz axis; 0 if no rz file)

  Then, all four normalized to [0, 1]:
    radial_norm   = r / r_max                (→ Pulse Width)
    azimuth_norm  = (cos φ + 1) / 2          (→ Pulse Rise)
    vradial_norm  = 0.5 + 0.5 × (dr/dt / p)  (→ Pulse Freq)
    omega_norm    = 0.5 + 0.5 × (dω/dt / p)  (→ Pulse Freq)

  All four are EMA-smoothed by:
    Knob:   Hold τ (s)
    Effect: Symmetric one-pole low-pass — kills chatter from small
            wobbles before the signals reach the pulse channels.

  End of Stage 3: four normalized drivers ready for Stage 5 to mix
  into the pulse parameter funscripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 4 — OUTPUT SIGNAL PROCESSING (on E1..En)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Post-projection cleanup and effects, acting on the per-electrode
  intensities. Order is deliberate — compression first so its
  gain-reduction edges get smoothed, not the other way around.

    1. Compress output (if enabled)
         Knobs:  Threshold, Ratio, Attack (ms), Release (ms), Makeup
         Effect: GLOBAL-envelope compressor — peak across all E's
                 drives a single gain-reduction applied uniformly to
                 every electrode. Flattens loudness cycles while
                 preserving per-frame spatial balance between the
                 electrodes.

    2. Smooth E1..En (if enabled)
         Knobs:  Cutoff Hz, Order
         Effect: Zero-phase Butterworth low-pass per electrode.

    3. Cross-electrode reverb (if master reverb enable is on)
         Knob:   Cross-E mix
         Effect: Each electrode's envelope receives delayed copies
                 of its neighbors' envelopes summed in.

    4. Dedup holds (if enabled)
         Knob:   Tolerance
         Effect: Drop interior samples of constant-within-tolerance
                 runs per electrode. Shrinks output files. Note: ALSO
                 collapses reverb tails — disable while tuning
                 reverb.

  End of Stage 4: final E1..En arrays, written as .e1..eN funscripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 5 — PARAMETER CHANNELS (emit separate funscripts)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Four device-critical channels emitted as their own funscripts.
  Each stays FLAT (2-point funscript = default value start to end)
  unless its mix knob is > 0, in which case it becomes a per-frame
  modulated funscript.

    FREQUENCY      →  .frequency
       freq = (1 − m) × Freq_default + m × speed_y
       Knobs used:    Freq default, Freq × |v| mix

    PULSE FREQUENCY →  .pulse_frequency
       pf = Pulse_freq_default
          + m₁ × (vradial_norm − 0.5)
          + m₂ × (omega_norm   − 0.5)
       Knobs used:    Pulse freq, PF × dr/dt, PF × dω/dt

    PULSE WIDTH    →  .pulse_width
       pw = (1 − m) × Pulse_width_default + m × radial_norm
       Knobs used:    Pulse width, PW × radial
       Optional tail: PW tail (reverb, only if PW × radial > 0)

    PULSE RISE TIME →  .pulse_rise_time
       pr = (1 − m) × Pulse_rise_default + m × azimuth_norm
       Knobs used:    Pulse rise, PR × azimuth

--------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY CONCEPTUAL POINTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Three signal paths fork after the projection.
    (a) Electrode intensities E1..En (Stage 4 → .e1..eN).
    (b) Volume envelope volume_y (Stages 2-Reverb, 2-Ramp; multiplies
        into the E's at write time).
    (c) Geometric derivatives (r, φ, dr/dt, dω/dt) feeding the pulse
        parameter channels in Stage 5.

  Mix knobs gate whether a channel is per-frame or flat.
    Freq × |v|, PW × radial, PR × azimuth, PF × dr/dt, PF × dω/dt
    are all 0 by default. When 0, the corresponding output is a
    two-point flat funscript; when > 0, it becomes a per-frame
    modulated funscript. This means "enabling" a geometric mapping
    isn't a property of geometry — it's a property of whether you
    want the output funscript to be static or dynamic.

  Order within Stage 4 matters.
    Compression → Smoothing → Cross-E reverb → Dedup. If you swap
    smoothing and compression, the compressor's gain-reduction edges
    survive into the output. If you run dedup before reverb, reverb
    tails get collapsed.

  Two smoothers exist, and they're different.
    Stage 1b "Smooth output (1€)" is velocity-adaptive — transparent
    on fast motion, heavy smoothing at rest. Good for killing tracker-
    driven flicker without dulling strokes.
    Stage 4 "Smooth E1..En" is a zero-phase Butterworth — uniform
    cutoff across all content. Good for killing persistent flicker
    regardless of motion. The two can stack if needed.

  Velocity weight vs Freq × |v| mix.
    Both derive from motion speed but feed different channels.
    Velocity-weight (Stage 1b) gates the per-electrode intensity so
    held positions go quiet. Freq × |v| mix (Stage 5) blends the
    flat carrier frequency with speed so fast motion raises the
    carrier. Use velocity-weight for "touch-while-moving" feel on
    the E outputs; use Freq × |v| to couple motion to pulse rate.

  Electrode gain + Soft-knee limiter are a pair.
    Gain > 1 pushes values above 1 which would hard-clip at the final
    clamp (crunchy peaks). Enabling the soft-knee limiter between the
    two rolls those peaks off smoothly. If you only use gain < 1, the
    limiter does nothing and can stay off.

  Noise gate is COHERENT across axes.
    One envelope drives all four axes simultaneously. A quiet Y
    doesn't close the gate if X is still moving — the gate follows
    the loudest axis in the window. This keeps the 3D trajectory
    geometrically valid (no collapse toward rest on one axis while
    another axis still swings).

  Sharpness raises selectivity.
    1.0 = linear falloff (smooth blend between adjacent electrodes).
    4-8 = near-one-at-a-time. Pair with Normalize = "per_frame" when
    you want "always one hot electrode" feel regardless of signal
    position.

  Y and Z are geometrically interchangeable inside Stage 1.
    The projection only sees sqrt((y−cy)² + (z−cz)²) — a radial
    distance from the shaft line. Y-vs-Z distinction survives only
    through Stage 3's azimuth = atan2(z, y), which feeds pulse_rise.
    If you want Y and Z to feel different on-device, you need
    PR × azimuth > 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO LOOK FOR EACH PARAMETER
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pre-projection shaping  → Stage 0   (noise gate, 1-Euro, sharpen)
  Spatial character       → Stage 1a  (Sharpness / Per-E sharp,
                                       Electrodes, Electrode pos,
                                       Y/Z weight, Falloff shape +
                                       width)
  In-kernel output shape  → Stage 1b  (Normalize, Smooth output (1€),
                                       Velocity-weight, Electrode
                                       gain, Soft-knee limiter,
                                       Solo / Mute mask)
  Intensity dynamics      → Stage 2   (Vol reverb, Ramp, Speed norm,
                                       Release τ, Speed floor)
  Pulse shape drivers     → Stage 3   (Hold τ — smooths all four
                                       geometric signals)
  Electrode cleanup       → Stage 4   (Compress, Butterworth smooth,
                                       Cross-E reverb, Dedup)
  Output channel gating   → Stage 5   (Freq default, Pulse freq,
                                       Pulse width, Pulse rise, and
                                       all × mix knobs)

  for the on-device tuning checklist.

25. SPATIAL 3D CURVE — 1D INPUT → 3D CURVE → N 3D ELECTRODES
================================================================================

Third projector alongside Trochoid Spatial and Spatial 3D Linear.
Opens a design space neither of the other two covers: non-planar
sensation traces driven by a single 1D input.

HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE OTHER TWO PROJECTORS:

  Trochoid Spatial     1D input → 2D curve → 4 angular electrodes
  Spatial 3D Linear    XYZ triplet → N electrodes along a line
  Spatial 3D Curve     1D input → 3D curve → N electrodes in 3D  ← here

The key distinction: trochoid's projection plane is 2D (curve and
electrodes both lie in xy), Linear 3D's electrodes are collinear,
and 3D Curve lifts the curve and the electrode array into full
three-dimensional space. Useful for rigs where electrodes are NOT
on a line (tetrahedral inside a chamber, ring around a
circumference, bespoke 3D layouts).

ENABLING:
  Open the "3D Curve" tab (Spatial / Curve Generators category) and
  check "Enable Spatial 3D Curve E1-E4 generation." While enabled,
  this overrides the response-curve motion-axis path for E1-E4 but
  is itself skipped if Traveling Wave or Trochoid Spatial is also
  active — priority order in the processor is wave > trochoid >
  3D curve > response curves.

CURVE FAMILIES (v1):

  helix            Ascending spiral along z. Params: r (radius),
                   h (total height), turns (full revolutions).
                   Simplest well-behaved option.

  trefoil_knot     Classic non-trivial knot: sin(t)+2sin(2t),
                   cos(t)-2cos(2t), -sin(3t). Params: scale.

  torus_knot       (p, q)-knot on a torus. (2, 3) = trefoil other
                   parameterization; (3, 2) = same knot other way.
                   Params: R (major radius), r (minor radius),
                   p / q (winding), scale.

  lissajous_3d     Three sinusoids with independent frequencies and
                   phases. Params: A/B/C amplitudes, a/b/c
                   frequencies, phi/psi phase offsets, scale.
                   Rational frequency ratios give closed curves;
                   irrational give space-filling motion.

  spherical_spiral Wraps along a unit sphere from pole to pole with
                   `c` longitudinal loops per pass. Params: c, scale.

ELECTRODE ARRANGEMENTS:

  tetrahedral  For N=4: vertices of a regular tetrahedron inscribed
               in the unit sphere (each at distance 1.0 from origin,
               inter-electrode distance √(8/3) ≈ 1.633). For N=3:
               equilateral triangle at z=0. Falls back to ring for
               other N.

  ring         N equally spaced points on the unit circle at z=0.

  custom       (Not yet in UI.) Caller supplies an (N, 3) positions
               array. Edit `spatial_3d_curve.electrode_positions_3d_custom`
               in config.json and set `electrode_arrangement` to
               'custom' to use.

SHARED SHAPING:
  Normalize, falloff shape, falloff width, output smoothing,
  per-electrode gain, soft-knee limiter, velocity weight, and
  solo/mute behave identically to Spatial 3D Linear (see section 24).
  For v1 they live under `spatial_3d_curve` in config.json only — a
  dedicated UI group will land in a follow-up. Defaults work out of
  the box.

PIPELINE INSIDE THE KERNEL:
  1. Clip input to [0, 1]; build θ = theta_max · cycles · input +
     theta_offset (close_on_loop rounds cycles to integer).
  2. Evaluate curve_xyz_3d(θ, family, params). Normalize to a
     unit-radius reference.
  3. For each electrode, compute 3D Euclidean distance and apply the
     selected falloff shape, then the per-electrode sharpness.
  4. Run through the shared output-shaping toolkit in Linear 3D
     order: normalize → 1€ smooth → velocity weight → gain →
     limiter → solo/mute → final clip.

WORKFLOW:
  1. Open the 3D Curve tab, pick a family, tweak per-family params.
  2. Adjust Sharpness / Cycles per stroke / Normalize / Falloff as
     desired.
  3. Save to a variant slot (A/B/C/D) so you can A/B against your
     existing Linear 3D or Trochoid tuning.
  4. Click "Process All Files" — outputs land next to the input.
  5. Inspect in the Animation Viewer; iterate.

================================================================================
26. T-CODE LIVE PREVIEW — EXTERNAL VLC SYNC
================================================================================

The T-Code Live Preview window streams processed signals to restim over
UDP while showing a local preview of the playhead + per-channel values.
It supports two playback sources:

  internal   — the embedded video backend (libvlc or cv2) drives the
               timeline. Classic single-window experience.
  vlc_http   — your own external VLC instance drives the timeline via
               its HTTP interface. T-code follows whatever VLC is
               playing — play/pause/seek in VLC, T-code keeps up.

The external mode is for users who prefer their own video player for
the actual viewing experience (full screen, hardware-accelerated,
subtitles, keyboard controls) and want funscript-tools in the
background as a T-code generator. No embedded video decode cost in
that mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW — DROP RAW FILES → VLC SYNCED (COMMON CASE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Drag X/Y/Z/rz funscripts into the main window (or a single
     .funscript / .x / .sway / .surge / .roll set).
  2. Click "Process All Files". Outputs land in <base>_variants/A
     (through D if you process multiple variants).
  3. Open the T-Code Live Preview (Tools menu or dedicated button).
  4. In the right-side "Media source" panel, click
     "Open video in VLC". This:
        • launches VLC with the project's video pre-loaded (uses
          `open -a VLC <video>` on macOS, VLC's file-association on
          Windows, `vlc` on Linux);
        • auto-switches Mode to vlc_http if it was still on internal;
        • starts polling VLC's HTTP interface at 10 Hz.
  5. Hit play in VLC. The Status label flips to
     "playing — <video name>".
  6. Click "Start Streaming" in the Restim panel — T-code starts
     flowing to restim at the correct timeline position. Seek in VLC
     and T-code follows within one poll interval.

Prerequisite: VLC's HTTP interface must be enabled. One-time setup:
  VLC → Preferences → Show All → Interface → Main interfaces → tick
  Web → Lua → Lua HTTP → set a password. Restart VLC. Every future
  launch then accepts HTTP connections automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MEDIA SOURCE PANEL — REFERENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Lives in the T-Code Live Preview's right-side scrollable controls,
between "Hot reload" and "Sync". Every control takes effect
immediately — no "Apply" needed except where noted.

Mode (dropdown: internal | vlc_http)
  Which source drives the signal clock.

  internal   — existing behaviour. The embedded video backend
               (configurable in config.json: preview.video_backend
               = "vlc" or "cv2") decodes frames, the scrub bar
               drives _playhead_t, and the T-code scheduler samples
               at that playhead.

  vlc_http   — spawns a polling adapter that queries VLC's HTTP
               status.xml every 100 ms. The scheduler reads VLC's
               reported position via the adapter's map_timestamp()
               (which interpolates between polls using the local
               monotonic clock, so you see smooth 60+ Hz T-code
               updates from 10 Hz polling).

VLC URL (text entry)
  Base URL of VLC's HTTP interface. Default
  http://127.0.0.1:8080 — works unchanged for the standard
  single-machine setup. Change only if you've configured VLC to
  listen on a different port, or you're driving a remote VLC.

Password (password-masked entry)
  Matches the HTTP password set in VLC's Preferences → Main
  interfaces → Lua → Lua HTTP → Password. VLC uses HTTP basic auth
  with an empty username, so only the password field is needed.

Apply (button)
  Re-reads URL + password and reconnects. Use after editing either
  without toggling modes. Also persists the values into the in-
  memory config under external_media.vlc_address /
  external_media.vlc_password — clicking "Save Config" in the main
  window writes them to disk.

Status (read-only label, updates every 500 ms)
  (disabled)          — mode is internal, adapter not running.
  connecting...       — adapter just started, first poll in flight.
  connected (no file) — HTTP reachable, auth OK, but VLC has no
                        media loaded.
  paused — <file>     — VLC has a file loaded but isn't playing.
  playing — <file>    — VLC is playing. T-code streaming follows.
  not connected — <error>  — HTTP error, auth failure, VLC not
                             running, etc. Error text is the
                             adapter's `last_error` string, trimmed
                             to the panel width. Common cases:
                               "Connection refused" = VLC not running
                                 or HTTP disabled.
                               "401 Client Error" = password wrong.
                               "Max retries exceeded" = URL wrong
                                 or firewall.

Auto-load funscripts from VLC's video (checkbox, default ON)
  When VLC reports a newly-loaded file, the panel derives parent
  folder + base stem and runs the standard funscript-tools
  variant-aware loader:

    /path/to/video.mp4  →  /path/to/video_variants/<slot>/
                             video.alpha.funscript, .e1, ...

  Variant selection is sticky across videos: if you had D selected
  on the previous video and the new video also has a D variant,
  loads that. Otherwise falls back to A (alphabetical first).

  If the video has no <base>_variants/ folder, falls back to flat-
  layout scan (files directly alongside the video). Source-motion
  files — suffixes .x / .y / .z / .rz / .sway / .heave / .surge /
  .roll / .twist / .stroke — are excluded from that flat scan so
  the loader doesn't misinterpret raw triplet input as processed
  output channels.

  Anti-thrash: the "last auto-loaded path" is remembered, so re-
  seeking within the same file won't reload. Changing videos
  triggers a fresh load.

Open video in VLC (button)
  Launches VLC with the project's video. Derived in priority order
  from main_window.input_files[0] (original source funscript's
  neighbour) → self._buffer_dir (walks up for _variants layouts)
  → self._video_path (embedded backend's file). macOS uses
  `open -a VLC`, which respects VLC's persistent Preferences
  (so the HTTP interface is already on if you set it up per the
  prerequisite above) and adds to the playlist of an already-
  running VLC rather than relaunching. Windows uses file
  association via `start`; Linux tries `vlc` directly with
  xdg-open fallback.

  If a video can't be resolved (no project loaded yet), shows a
  short info dialog and does nothing. If launching VLC itself
  fails (not installed, bad path), shows the error in a dialog.

  Side effect: auto-switches Mode to vlc_http if it was internal.
  Respects your explicit mode choice otherwise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGNAL CLOCK PRIORITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

_signal_clock() in the scheduler thread decides what timestamp to
sample for the next T-code frame. Priority order:

  1. External media source (vlc_http mode, connected with file
     loaded) — returns external.map_timestamp(time.time()). Wins
     whenever active so the scheduler follows VLC's timeline
     regardless of the embedded video's state.

  2. Embedded video + "Lock stim to video" — returns the actual
     decoded-frame time. Stim stays visually synced at the cost
     of running at decode rate.

  3. Local wall-clock playhead — _playhead_t. Used when the lock
     is off, no video is loaded, or no external source is
     connected.

Practical upshot: in vlc_http mode you do NOT need to press Play
in the T-Code Preview window itself — just start streaming. The
scheduler sees VLC's state and plays/pauses accordingly. The local
Play button is only for internal mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
POLLING CADENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The VLC adapter runs a single daemon threading.Timer:

  100 ms    nominal cadence while connected (10 Hz heartbeat)
  2000 ms   between failed connection attempts during initial
            connect / VLC unreachable
  5000 ms   when the configured URL is invalid (missing scheme etc.)

Idle network cost: ~1 KB/s to localhost, <1% CPU. T-code output
smoothness is unaffected because map_timestamp() interpolates
between polls against the local monotonic clock.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIG KEYS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

config.json

  external_media.vlc_address          Seeds the VLC URL entry.
                                      Default http://127.0.0.1:8080.
  external_media.vlc_password         Seeds the Password entry.
                                      Stored plaintext — don't use
                                      a shared secret here.
  ui.tcode_preview_fps                Preview tick rate. Overrides
                                      the class default of 24.
                                      Clamped to [5, 60]. Live
                                      spinner in the playback bar
                                      also writes this value.

All three are optional; the preview works fine with an empty
config.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS MESSAGE FOR RAW SOURCE FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you open the preview with only raw motion files next to the
video (X/Y/Z/rz, stroke/sway/surge/roll) and no processed variants
yet, the Signals summary reads:

  "Source files present (N) but no processed signals — click
   'Process All Files' in the main window, then Reload here."

rather than the confusing "Loaded 0:" you'd have seen previously.
This is triggered by any combination of the source-motion suffix
set (see auto-load section above) present in the folder with no
matching processed-signal files (alpha/beta/e1..e4/pulse_*/
frequency/volume).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS (V1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  • VLC is the only external player supported. MPC-HC, Kodi, and
    HereSphere adapters exist in the upstream restim project
    (ui/media_source/ is a port of that layer); they can be added
    here following the same pattern when there's demand.
  • No auto-start-streaming on VLC play. You still click Start
    Streaming once per session; after that, VLC drives play/pause.
  • Embedded video panel stays visible when vlc_http is active.
    If you don't want the embedded decode running in parallel,
    uncheck "Show video" manually — the adapter doesn't need it.
  • Variant sticky selection is across the session, not persisted
    per-video. Switching back to an earlier video uses the
    currently-active slot rather than remembering what that
    video's last variant was.
